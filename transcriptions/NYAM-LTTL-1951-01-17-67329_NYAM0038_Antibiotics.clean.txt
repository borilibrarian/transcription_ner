>> Good evening. From the Auditorium of the New York Academy of Medicine, your city stations bring you the fourth in the Academy's annual series of lectures to the laity. These lectures, which are open to the public free of charge, and are broadcast by your city's stations, are intended to bring to the public knowledge and understanding of the significant developments in medicine. As well as insight into the processes by which these developments are achieved. In language which the intelligent layman understands, the men who have made progress in the many fields on a discussion, actually tell of their experiences and discoveries. Tonight Dr. Paul R. Burkholder, the Eaton Professor of Botany at Yale, will talk on the quest for antibiotics. Now here to open tonight's lecture to the laity, is Chairman of the Committee for the Series, Dr. Harold B. Keyes.

>> Dr. Harold B. Keyes: Good evening ladies and gentlemen. We welcome you here again tonight. I've been asked to make a brief announcement. You will notice that you have been given slips of paper on which you may write questions to be presented at the end of the lecture. We're anxious to have you present questions for the speaker to answer. It isn't always possible to answer all of the questions. Many of them are duplicates. However, we wish you to know that you are entitled to an answer. And if there's any particular question you wish answered -- and if not answered during the meeting -- please write you question to Dr. Lago Galdston, Secretary of the Committee of Medical Information, at this academy of medicine, and you will receive a reply. The most distinguished honor it is possible for the Academy of Medicine to render to one of its fellows is the election to the Office of the President of the Academy of Medicine. It is now my pleasure and my privilege to introduce to you, Dr. William Barclay Parson. The President of the New York Academy of Medicine. Dr. Parsons.

>> Dr. William Barclay Parson: Thank you very much Dr. Keyes. On behalf of the Academy of Medicine, I want to welcome not only all of you who are here in this room tonight, but also the audience of whoever - wherever they may be throughout this city, who are listening in to this program, on the part of WNYC. We have the great privilege of hearing tonight, two outstanding authorities in the field of antibiotics. I take great pleasure in introducing to you the Chairman of this evening's session, Dr. Selman Waxman. Whom you will remember as having delivered a distinguished lecture to the laity on last years series on the biology of the antibiotics. Dr. Waxman has been among the earliest pioneers in the search for, and discovery of antibiotics. The so-called miracle drugs, because of their spectacular affect upon disease-causing agents. Chairman of the Department of Microbiology at Rutger's University, Dr. Waxman is perhaps most frequently associated in the public's mind as the discoverer of streptomycin. It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you, Dr. Waxman.

>> Dr. Selman Waxman: Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. In the biblical Nimrod, the mighty hunter before the Lord, went out in search of animals. Either to be domesticated, or to be used for food for his family and his travels. He started a great tradition, which has come down, and uninterrupted although variously modified stages to our very day. In recent times there have been among us two types of hunters. Those who went after wild game. Hunting food to satisfy their natural instinct of killing wild forms of life. Or to obtain living or dead trophies to impress the folks who remained at home. And those, the naturalists, especially the ecologists and the botanists, who went out in search of wild animals or plants, which would increase our knowledge of the living world. Those helping to establish the fundamental principals of the origin of species. Improve our floricultural, horticultural, and zoological collections. Add new plants to our diet. Those enriching it in quality and in quantity. Or find animal forms which could be utilized for combating newly imported insects and other pests. During very recent years, however, a new type of hunter has appeared in our midst. A microbe hunter -- if I may be permitted to paraphrase Dr. [Inaudible]. "Having isolated and cultivated the microbes that cause numerous infectious diseases. Having domesticated the microbes of fermentation, as well as those inhabit our soils, our manure piles, our seas and our lakes. Having going on to control many microbes that cause spoilage and decomposition. This type of hunter has now gone in search of microbes that are able to destroy disease-producing germs." Let's take advantage of the fact that many microbes found largely among the fungi, the bacteria, and [inaudible], are capable of producing certain chemical substances designated as antibiotics. Which have the capacity to destroy disease-producing organisms. He has isolated such microbes. He has cultivated and domesticated them. And has made them for use, such substances on a an extensive scale. Thus supplying to the medical profession, new and powerful tools for combating numerous infections and academics. Thus the age of antibiotics, which is only a decade or so old, has opened a new chapter in chemotherapy. New antibiotics are isolated almost daily. And the thousand of laboratories working on them throughout the world. These antibiotics, however do not appear full-fledged, like Venus from the head of Zeus. It is true that some, notably penicillin, are a result of chance observation. Although there as well, it came to the prepared mind. The mind, who from this knowledge of lysozyme could interpret the action of the mold and the bacteria on the plate. Most of the other antibiotics, however, beginning with Tyrothricin, in 1939 and ending with terramycin in 1949. All the result of detailed and painstaking studies. Many thousands of cultures have been isolated and tested. Hundreds of substances have been found in these cultures. All had to be carefully evaluated before one could be found, which had desirable therapeutic properties. For a new antibiotic to become an effective agent, it has to possess low toxicity to animals. Desirable, physical properties. And a special type of activity against those infectious diseases that are not affected by other agents already in use. Among the antibiotic reducing microorganisms, the terramyces occupy a very prominent place. Since the rediscovery of penicillin in 1940, that terramyces have yielded some of the most important therapeutic agents now in use. It is sufficient to mention streptomycin, chloromycetin, aureomycine, terramycin and neomycin, all produced by members of one genoas, streptomyces. The speaker this evening is a mighty hunter in the modern sense. He was responsible for the isolation of the culture which yielded chloromycetin. He has experienced all the joy involved in the hunt. He has felt the gratification of discovery. He has found himself at home in the new field of domestication of microbes. He is to share some of his experiences with us tonight. It is therefore, a great pleasure indeed for me to introduce Dr. Paul Burkholder, Professor of Botany at Yale University. Dr. Paul.

>> Dr. Paul R. Burkholder: Mr. President. Fellow scientists. Ladies and gentlemen. It has long been a custom for a speaker after dinner to have began his speech with stories. It so happens that I don't know any good stories, and Dr. Waksman and I agreed that we wouldn't tell any bad ones [background chuckles]. So since he lived up to his part of the bargain, I'll have to live up to mine. So I'm going to launch at once into a discussion with you in a very informal fashion, of this very interesting quest for antibiotic substances, which apparently has considerable significance for the laity. I was instructed to talk to the laity, which I am glad to do, because I needn't strain myself to use extraordinary large words to impress my fellow scientists, and all these famous physicians who are here tonight. The quest for antibiotic substances, I suppose, is engaged in for the shear pleasure of doing so by the hunter. And perhaps he feels that if he is somewhat fortunate, he may bag some game which may be of value to his fellow man. I was told by a professor who told me what little I learned at Cornell, up to the time I got a PhD degree, which wasn't much, that any work I ever did in science would be for the fun of it. Not because I wanted to achieve fame, or do anything great. I think that was a good piece of advice to give me, because I'm still learning and still searching for things that give us pleasure, and incidentally may -- be more than harmless, may be beneficial to all of us. Now to those of you who are sitting out there around the fireside, I wish it were possible for me to be on television. Not because I'm anything but a handsome man [background chuckles] but because I believe in the Chinese proverb that pictures tell more than words. That is a picture tells more than 1,000 words. And I have some pictures that I want to show the audience, who took the trouble to come over here in the Academy of Medicine Building tonight. And I'll talk, in a way I hope that will describe some of the pictures. Now that means that I'll have to speak for about 10 hours only, in order to talk about my pictures, since they are not going to talk for me, to the audience who is listening on the radio. Well I think we may as well begin with some of the pictures, and the things that I say as we go along will actually not necessitate that you be far-sighted. Or have opera glasses. Or a television set. We'll try to portray to you a little of the zest that one finds in a quest for antibiotic substances. I'm showing, first of all, a slide of South America. Because one of my graduate students, after a lecture in bacteriology at Cornell, jumped up out of his seat and sat on top of the desk, and finally admitted to me that I'd gotten under his skin. What he wanted to do about this antibiotic story was to go around South America and collect soil samples for me. So we found the money and flew him 25,000 miles around South America. And a map of South America, plotting the course that this Mr. Benedict took a couple of years ago illustrates what a wonderful itinerary one can have in a quest for microbes, which may produce antibiotic substances. Incidentally this man was young and handsome, and had quite a good time meeting the secretary -- the lady secretaries in all the embassies of the South American ligations. And then when he got back, the Central Intelligence Offices came around and wanted to know, Burkholder and Benedict, are you really so interested in soil samples? Or do you have something else in mind about overthrowing the governments of South America by violence. And I had to persuade these gentlemen that I had very high intentions in this regard. Well, after one obtains a great many cultures of soil -- a great many samples of soil, a pinch is about all one needs, because as Dr. Dr. Watson has shown in his soils laboratories down at Rutgers, a pinch of soil can have not scores, not hundreds, but thousands of millions of microbes. And one then is confronted with the task of finding the ones that might do us some good and not bothering about those that we haven't time at the moment to study. Because there are many interesting problems in connection with finding out the truth about the activities of microbes in mother soil. Now these pinches of soil in laboratories where men are searching for antibiotics, and many such laboratories scattered across the country in industry. In university laboratories. And even in private laboratories for the fun of it. Perhaps also for the profit of it.

[ Background Sounds ]

Now these pinches of soil have so many microbes that they have to be suspended in a little water and diluted. Because there's too many microbes, it's an abomination even to [inaudible] microbes. And he wants to find a way of separating one time by itself. So you can pry into their secrets and find out just what they're doing. And so then a pinch of soil is suspended in water and shaken up. And the microbes are then spread out on the surface of little glass dishes called petri dishes, named after an Italian bacteriologist many years ago. And in the dish is not water, but a wet Jell-O kind of material lets the bacteriologist [inaudible]. It's made from seaweed, and makes a nice, smooth transfer medium on which microbes like to grow, provided you feed them the things they like. And this we do in these laboratories across the country. And wait a day or two until they grow up and tell us about themselves. That is they grow into discrete colonies scattered over the plate. And I'm going to show several lantern slides. Some in color. And I hope you can see them in the audience. And those of you who can't see them, I'll have to say a few words about them. And if we may have the first slide illustrating some of the little creatures that grow in our petri dishes on the nutrient Jell-O or auger. Sometimes these organisms don't like each other. They happen to make these chemical compounds in their metabolism, which some of us like to refer to as antibiotics. I'm not sure this is an excellent word, because antibiotic means "against life". Well, antibiotics are not against all life. They are frequently not killing the organism which makes the substance, but are inimical to associated organisms nearby, and often show zones of innovation on the plate in a way as to indicate that the microbe making the antibiotic chemical compound as much as says, you other associated microbes, stay at some distance and let me alone because I have to eat here and live here. And I don't want you in competition. So it seems to some of us at least, that nature has evolved over long periods of years. Microbes with methods of chemical warfare against their associates. That is, they produce these substances and throw them out into the immediate environment. And in this way have learned to protect themselves by chemical means. Now not all of the workers in science agree on these points that I may mention as I go along. But I must say that this particular point, I have followed up recently in soils where we actually found that some antibiotics are produced in appreciable quantities in soil. Whereas others are not made in detectable amounts. And one has to urge the microbe to make antibiotics of, in some instances, of therapeutic value in treating the diseases of mankind by feeding the microbe a precursor material. Or a stimulating chemical, urging it thus to go ahead and make the substances that we want to collect a lot of. Whereas out in nature, only traces are made. In the laboratory, under controlled conditions, a great amount of antibiotic material may be elaborated by certain bacteria or certain fungi. Or certain microbes, which we call actinomycin. Now we will move along rapidly, showing several other slides on the screen. Some of them in color showing pink and the yellow and the bluish organisms that can be very beautiful. So the researcher in the field of microbiology, ought to have an aesthetic appreciation for his organisms as he goes along in the quest of scientific goals. There can be beauty even in microbes. And I think that many young microbiologists are first attracted by the coloration. The texture. The beautiful patterns that would be a challenge to a textile and wallpaper designers. Now we move along to show certain cultures in test tubes on the nutrient material of a semi-solid gel consistency. And with cotton plugs kept in the tubes to keep the dust out. And then we plant our microbiological gardens. One kind of microbe at a time in each of the tubes. And in this way, having transferred them from the original plates of nutrient Jell-O in the petri dishes, from the soil you see, we now have separated one kind by itself in a stock culture tube, where it can be stored -- after growing at room temperature -- can then be stored in the ice box, or modern refrigerator. Until such time as one can get around to really give serious study to the different kinds. And there are many kinds. We have in our home laboratory in New Haven, isolated perhaps around 60,000 cultures of actinomycins alone. Other laboratories, I think, have outdone us in the quest for microbes manufacturing antibiotic substances. So I'd imagine it goes up into several hundreds of thousands of isolated cultures over the past few years, which have been subjected to scrutiny in this connection. There are so many kinds, that it is really a challenge to a student who is looking for something to take hold of as a profession to learn enough about these things so we can call them by their first names. That is a challenge when one has thousands of cultures, it's very difficult to decide which ones ought to be studied in other ways than just antibiotically. The next picture that I'm showing here in [inaudible] illustrates what happens in a petri dish when one smears several kinds of microbes together. And this particular example of red bacteria and yellowish bacteria, and some white yeast shows that they don't mind living together. Certain organisms don't harm others. They seem to get along -- compete of course, as other plants and animals do for sustenance and Laman's [inaudible] as we generally call it. But they don't make necessarily an antibiotic substance, and kill their associates off. They've learned to live together in a more or less friendly fashion. Now we will show other examples, and it's easy to find them. Where there is mechanical interference, organisms don't run over each other, they stay within boundaries. Or actually may produce substances such as can be illustrated when one takes the streptomyces vicious, which Dr. Watson discovered and studied so intensively. And suppose we grow some of that on a petri dish. And then present, as a challenge, some susceptible bacteria by spraying them with an atomizer maybe. All over the [inaudible] in the auger. And in a day or two, these bacteria will grow up. But not very close to the streptomyces, making streptomycin. Because the coli organisms that live in a colony in the intestines of man, not entirely harmlessly. But these are susceptible to streptomycin as a weapon made by streptomyces. Incidentally I mentioned here in passing that these coliform bacteria which inhabit the intestines of mammals [inaudible] around the world, in which in the past have thought to be -- were thought to be just there for no particular harm or benefit. But just now we're studying many aspects of microbiology, in addition to antibiotics [inaudible]. And among them, the fact has recently emerged that some of these coli organisms which are inhibited by streptomycin or terramycin or aureomycine -- the other antibiotics are well known in the profession now. These coli organisms are stealing the anti-pernicious anemia, vitamin B12, away from certain people who don't have the right kind of gastric juice to protect themselves against the stealing activities of these formerly called harmless coli bacteria. So the problem gets more and more complicated. It's not only a matter of killing disease-producing bacteria, but controlling the organisms that are not so pathogenic, but perhaps we just don't want them around. Or we want to cultivate them. Domesticate them and train them to our own purposes. This is legitimate. I'd just like to say here that a big book called "Bergies Manual" known to bacteriologists describes about 1,650 kinds of bacteria. And only a very few -- a little handful of these cause disease. But since they do, it allows the profession to make a living in medicine. And it provides a reason for some of us to be hunting for antibiotics. But bacteria are not bad as a whole, only a few of them don't behave themselves, and we have to do our best to control their activity. Now we'll move along rapidly, showing a few more slides now of relationships of different types on these auger or Jell-O plates where the medium is transparent. And when you grow these gardens of microbes of many kinds, you can study their relationships very neatly. I'm showing slides now that illustrate how a mold will grow right over the coli organisms. And also pass right over the streptomyces which keeps coli at a distance, but is utterly impotent against it, warding off a fusarium mold. So there are many kinds of relationships that are easy to visualize when we have pictures to show them. And I think that word pictures are almost as good. For example, one can grow a selected soil actinomycin in the middle of the petri dish, and then spray or dust on the plate after several days, the spores of that common household pest that gets into the refrigerator and spoils food. That aspergillus niger, the black mold. Well that mold is hard to inhibit. But some of the atinomycides, which Dr. Waksman and others here at the [inaudible] in the house have studied, do inhibit even those molds that get on potatoes and bread and spoil the leftovers from the table if you don't watch out. It's easy to detect the activities of these organisms by growing them then on our plates in the laboratory on suitable media, and then presenting in proximity to this growth of the so-called or suspected antibiotic producing microbe. These other test bacteria or molds, or whatever one wishes to use. And there are a variety of ways of doing this. And then there are zones of innovation often produced where the substance keeps the test organisms at some distance. And one can measure this and get some idea of activity of these antibiotic producers. Now not always are they producing antibiotics. Sometimes they are helping each other as we showed on a slide here. Where two organisms exchange vitamins actually, for the mutual welfare of the two. So I want to just indicate to you that there are many types of promotion and innovation, I'm pointing out now here how one can follow the pattern laid down by Mr. Haskow [phonetic] here in New York, an anthropologist and a scientist. Where weak and strong organisms can be mated or presented to each other in close proximity and they may devour each other or get a long very well in helping each other in sort of the symbiosis or give-and-take situation as in matrimony. Or they may be neutral. They may kill each other. There are all sorts of combination effects which we haven't time to go into in detail here. But I just wanted to make certain that our audience understands that microbes are not all bad. They're not all good. They don't all fight each other. Some of them cooperate. Perhaps they learned that in advance of man learning about cooperation. But what a microbe has learned, I think a man should be able to learn [background chuckles]. Now the subject of antibiotics, as most people know I suppose now, is not very new. I have here a picture made back in 1889 of the innovation on a petri dish of certain very bad bacteria -- the Anthrax bacteria -- put together with associates of micrococcus bacteria. And here is an innovation picture. The photograph was made in 1889 over in Paris by [Inaudible] a famous, physiological chemist, who founded a well-known journal which published research papers about biochemistry and physiology. But he, as a young man was so interested in this then new aspect of the antimicrobial relationships, that he wanted to make a picture. And with one of those early cameras, recorded a picture which I'm showing here tonight. So at least in 1889 you see, there is a photographic record of antibiosis, as a phenomenon which is much older than much of us here tonight.

[ Pause ]

Some of us have been interested in other relationships than those which are obvious in the field of medicine. Where one tames a bacterium and forces it to provide in our hands, a drug to inhibit harmful bacteria.

[ Pause ]

Out in the soil there are certain relationships that we've shown here and I'm going to present in a picture now, of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria being inhibited by a certain other organisms, which we got out of soil in the Texas panhandle. The [inaudible] bacteria -- nitrogen-fixing bacteria might be said to be friends of the farmer because they have that unique property -- almost unique property of capturing the nitrogen of the atmosphere, which we are unable to use directly. And fix it in the soil where crop plants find it available then. And eventually of course it finds its -- that nitrogen finds its way into beef steak and into our own nutrition. Well there are microbes out there in the soil which inhibit the [inaudible] and be demonstrated in soil cultures. Also there are many other examples of sources of antibiotics being produced by numerous kinds of organisms, which one doesn't ordinarily think of in the laboratory. Even high plants; trees make certain antibiotics. And the substances used in brewing beer; hop substances have inhibitory properties, which have been used unwittingly I suppose, for centuries. But the brewers know about it now. They're not very potent antibiotic substances. These substances known as humulon and glupulon [phonetic] that occur in the hops plant. But they have no particular effect on the yeast in making beer. They do inhibit the development of certain bacteria that might tend to make vinegar instead of beer, then the brewer's intention was otherwise. Even soil algae we have found to be inhibited by certain actinomycins and fungi. And I'm showing here a picture of -- demonstrating the inhibition by zanthromycin [phonetic], a prepared cure from certain actinomycins and applied to petri dishes on little pieces of filter paper. And the substance diffuses out and you have a certain algae in your culture there. Now this is not only of academic value. It constitutes a tool because we can use this expanded list of microorganisms, embracing even the green algae as tools for deciding whether a new antibiotic is really new, or whether it's one of the well-known ones. Because we can widen the so-called spectrum or range of tool organisms -- indicator organisms to include bacteria, yeast, molds, and algae, and even viruses if we have developed a suitable technique. Now I'd like to speak very briefly for a moment only about an interesting new source of antibiotics, that it was new several years ago. And one summer I decided to have a little vacation on top of Mt. Washington for a week, and decided to collect some of the lichens that grow there on the rocks. And we took them home and tested them on various bacteria, and found sure enough, they inhibit the gram positive bacteria and not the gram negative bacteria. Also inhibit the acid fast bacteria of the group causing tuberculosis. And I'm showing here, it's a very colorful picture of the redheaded cladonia lichen which grow in the mountains of New Hampshire, and also New York state and many other places. Easy to demonstrate, that approximately 50% of these so-called worthless lichens growing on rocks cause antibiosis in a petri dish, the usual type, one can apply in little cups or little pieces of filter paper, the substance is extracted easily in a water solution from lichen and show that there's appreciable activity. In our laboratories recently we have succeeded in isolating the fungi in pure culture from lichens. Drawn them in shaking the flasks of the nutrient sugar solution. And proved that the fungus component of the lichen -- which is a mixture of fungi and algae -- actually produces the antibiotic substance. Some laboratories seem to be quite interested in usnic acid, one of the substances made commonly by such organisms. And I'm showing here the structural formula of some of the molecules. Usnic acid, didenic acid [phonetic], stutsman and grisiofulven [phonetic] which are technical names for the peculiar names of ring structure molecules manufactured by lichen. And some of our Japanese scientific friends worked all along during the last -- Second World War -- on these substances. And at the close of the war, found that sure enough, in America people had been studying the same things that they had been studying. They specialize a great deal on activity of many kinds of lichen substances, which in structural formula, they [inaudible]. And it's excellent work that I'd like to take my hat off to some of the Japanese scientists who had the courage to work under very trying conditions back in those days, in the Second World War. And at the close of that war I received very kind letters pleading that -- with us that scientists in America would not hold any enmity against the scientists in Japan. Because we were brothers together, trying to solve some of the problems of biology. And they hoped that we could be friends again. Exchange scientific acquaintanceship via letters and exchanges of papers. I thought that was very fine instead. And I responded to this even though I lost in the war with Japan some very close relatives. Now I'm going to show a few more molecules of the kinds of well known antibiotics. Here is penicillin. Which is a kind of peptide. We can show with the structural formula that the amino acids are linked together in a way that is not suitable for most microbes of the gram positive bacterial group. And so such a molecule as penicillin acts as a monkey wrench. Which can be thrown into the machinery of metabolism of susceptible bacteria. And spoil their life activities. And fortunately enough, this can be done with some of the dread enemy microbes of mankind. And as you all know from magazine and newspaper article, this has been a great boom to mankind. Now we will indicate that the central theme in penicillin is a kind of ring compound with side chains of carbon of various lengths and kinds of fats. And there are a number of penicillin's. And one can, with suitable knowledge, synthesize even more penicillin's than have been found in nature, made by many kinds of fungi. I'm [coughs] showing some rather bad lantern slides, so the people in the radio audience aren't missing very much. Some of these things are barely legible from the back of the room I'm sure. But I have one now here before us, that merely illustrates how the yield of penicillin was stepped up during the early days in the history of this drug. From just a trace to perhaps 1,000 units of penicillin per milliliters, for a small fraction of a spoonful of liquid. Being made then by penicillin mold. And since then, by proper manipulation of the genetic constitution by mutating them with radiation from an ultraviolet lamp or from an x-ray machine, and then feeding them certain making substances, which are synthesized by the molds to make penicillin, it's possible to go up now to more than 3,000 units per few drops of liquid, or milliliter in the technical term. So it pays to continue studying the drug. Because when it's first discovered, the price is high, and only the Ritz can buy. And after methods of assay are developed, and we're showing here a picture illustrating how simple it is, indeed, to put dilutions of a drug like penicillin out on a petri dish, and just measure the diameter of inhibition zone, where the test microbe is kept from growing, near the point where the drug was placed on the dish. And so as the industrial companies find it easier and easier to make more and more of a drug like penicillin, then the price comes down. And there are two general methods for testing of the potency of penicillin or other antibiotic solution. The auger plate method and the test tube method, where appropriate dilutions are made, and one sees then how much the drug can be diluted down, and still have activity. And with simple arithmetic you can calculate -- even grade school arithmetic, how much there was there. And whether it pays to manufacture it in this particular way. The unit for penicillin and the diameter of inhibition zone can be plotted on a little graph, and with simple math methods that grade school children use, a scientist can use the same approach and come out with answers that are not too far wrong. Sometimes they're almost exactly right. If one plots, for example, in the years 1943 to 1948, the production of penicillin in numbers of units, it goes from a very low level indeed, up to a tremendous figure. And even now, more still than back in those years of rapid expansion of the industry of penicillin making. Until it should be reckoned in what? Thousands of billions of units? That's really -- a unit is too small, so it takes so many cycles to express the production. And if one plots the price over those years of 1943 to 1948, the price, very high can become to drop down smoothly on a graph to practically nothing. They're almost given away now in the drug stores [background comments]. The graph shows zero, but it's just above the zero level. Well that's fortunate I think. And I'm sure it will happen with other, new antibiotics as they come along and enough is learned about them to produce adequate amounts inexpensively. Streptomycin, it's -- the gentleman who introduced me, Professor Waksman, had so much to do with, it's shown here to be a rather complicated molecule, as contrasted with penicillin, somewhat simpler. And still there are much more complicated molecules than streptomycin. We will not say so much about the streptomycin, and the -- some terramycin and other drugs here tonight, because there are people coming up in this lecture series who will have much more to say about it, than I could possibly tell tonight. So we move along rapidly to a consideration of some other aspects of antibiotics, showing that there can be quite a list of organisms, pathogenic in nature, which can be controlled with a drug like streptomycin, for example. The gram negative bacteria. Which penicillin doesn't touch, except in huge quantities. And sometimes not even then. And so one has to keep on the search for new and better drugs with which to combat the microbes which are bothering us; making us ill and very unhappy. And so the search goes on. And streptomycin, I suppose, could be said to be the number two drug, or was, certainly it's hard to evaluate these things. As knowledge progresses, new drugs are coming to the limelight, and capture our imagination. And are produced in tremendous amounts and distributed rapidly. Because of the things that the old drugs won't do, the new drugs seem to be exceedingly important to us and we go on to talk about that. Now let's do that. Sometimes we find that our facilities are imagination, and ability to devise experimental approaches, with which to find drugs active against viruses for example. Such as a cause of infantile paralysis or many other dreaded diseases. The techniques of finding these -- new antibiotics -- against viruses are not easy. I'm showing an illustration of the "egg" method where newly hatching eggs can be implanted with certain viruses. And then the antibiotic substances placed in these eggs, and tests made -- not easily, but with some difficulty -- tests can be made to evaluate the antiviral activity of a new drug. This seems to me to be an exceptionally important field to find antiviral drugs. I want to refer now, very briefly, to chloromycetin or chloramphenicol, as some people like to call the drug. But we had something to do with in the early days of its history. And showing here is a mass of the actinomycite photographed under the microscope. They don't look like much, but disheveled bits of hair. Little filaments in masses. In real life they are, oh, perhaps an 1/8 of an inch in diameter and quite fuzzy. And don't look like much of anything important. But they do make this chloromycetin, which turned out to be the first antibiotic of value against the larger viruses or recapsule [phonetic] bodies.

[ Pause ]

And they also turned out to be the first drug which was simple enough for the chemist to synthesize. So that just by happenstance, the chloromycetin was a simple compound and rather easy to work with. And have been [inaudible] now in quantity by the synthetic processes in a chemical laboratory. We don't have to rely upon the -- there is no microbe which invented the antibiotic. Man has learned how to make it more feasibly than with microbes. And this tangled mass of stuff that looks like wet hair when it grows in a culture sugar media. And can be growing in large tanks of [inaudible] substance. [Inaudible] we'll describe [inaudible] and I don't have to linger on it longer here. We're showing how simple the molecule really is. It was unique -- or most unique, not quite -- in having chlorine present in the molecule, as one can see by drawing out the diagram of its molecular formula. Chlorine is present, and also a nitro group. Now that nitro group is unusual in the natural compound. Very unusual. The young lady whose job it was to synthesize the nitro fluromycitin [phonetic], a compound found at the -- sure enough, nitro compounds are explosive sometimes. And so in the earlier experiments, the platinum crucible was driven down through the tabletop by the explosion of some of the nitro precursor materials that she was studying. Fortunately no damage done to the lady or scientist who was doing such an excellent job on the [inaudible] out in the Parke Davis laboratory in Detroit. I'm -- well I must take [inaudible] to -- give full credit to the grand, large team of investigators at Detroit who took up the work where we had to abandon for the lack of facilities and know-how and time. About 65 to 67 people, chemists and -- of all sorts. And microbiologists and clinicians teamed up together and hurried the job along and got out this job in a rather short time. I think the record time though has been beaten since by some people here in the audience who have made the drug known as terramycin. They really did a fast job out of it, if our information's correct. So with an increase of modern technical knowledge about these things, I think that we ought to be able to hurry it up even faster yet. And find the new drugs that so many people are waiting for and need. I'm showing a picture here of a large tank in which antibiotics can be made. There's a man standing down in the bottom looking up to a loft filled with lights there at the camera, which took the shots from the top of the tank. And it looked much like one of these huge beer brewing vats in the old-fashioned beer industry. But here pure cultures are grown on controlled media and appreciable yields of drugs can be made. And with the knowledge of how to do it. This requires not only academic knowledge, but it requires engineering skill to do this modern stunt of producing antibiotics in quantity. The affect of antibiotic drugs on the microbes which are inhibited by them, is something which would carry us way beyond the allotted time tonight. And I really want to refer to the fact that penicillin, as an example of an antibiotic drug acting on a susceptible bacteria, may attack them when they're trying to grow, and keep them from growing. It may permit the accumulation of certain growth substances within the cells, but they can't divide and multiply their kind, so eventually they'll have to give up. The knowledge about the mechanism of action of these monkey wrenches thrown into the machinery of the microbes. The pathogenic bacteria causing disease and what not. It needs much greater study. And I feel that as the studies in this field develop, that we will more and more approach a rational kind of chemotherapy, rather than this trial and error -- or should I say trial and success method, which some of us have been having some fun with in the last decade. I feel that in the future when enough is known about the fundamental machinery of the bacteria and the viruses and pathogenic yeast, fungi and so on, and protozoa too that cause disease, then I believe that we will realize that these pest organisms have unique kinds of processes that make them what they are and that we, as human beings, do not have certain unique machinery in the cells of our bodies. So that a monkey wrench thrown in their machinery, in the right spot you see, is not going to interfere with us. With our metabolism. Hence, will not cause drug toxicity. So that in the future I think a rational approach -- paper chemistry, if you want to call it that -- or paper biology and chemistry and all it takes to do the job. What we need is knowledge, and then the application of this knowledge I think will open up a brand new field, which perhaps will supplant the antibiotic age in which we are now living. I feel that it would be highly unlikely that 20 years from now, that the current antibiotic substances would still be in use. I think that we're going to go on and find new kinds of drugs, perhaps with new approaches. New knowledge, and new technique. Some of the bacteria have been studied in relation to the problem of mechanism inhibition by streptomycin, penicillin, and other drugs, turn out to have different points in their metabolism inhibited by these drugs. That is, that some of the substances present in the formation of the very core or heart of a bacterial cell. The nuclear body, are prevented from being formed by some drugs like penicillin or ceptomycin. And then still other drugs do not affect the organism in this way, they do it in other ways. But we can't go into this in detail tonight. I want to hurry along and take up certain other aspect, which I think will constitute an urge for us to keep pressing on in our quest. And we will now indicate to you one of the additional reasons for continuing the search for drug substances. It is easy to demonstrate that when a so-called pure culture, one kind of microbe is being tested, that eventually when substances are tried out on it to see whether they will inhibit this microbe, that yes, most of the population is inhibited. But a few organisms are able to grow. These are called resistant organisms. And apparently they arise in a mass population, which is making a new microbe from an old one every 20 or 30 minutes. So that after a while -- after a few hours you have a terrific lot of them, and once in a while when a microbe is dividing to make two, then something a little different happens. We call it mutation. They change. And the inheritance of the microbe takes place. And occasionally in the direction of developing resistance to the good old drug. So we have a chance to demonstrate that by plating up our bacteria, and see that within an inhibition zone on a Jell-O plate, there are suddenly showing up resistant bacteria. And this may happen in a patient as well. A patient may be getting along fairly well under drug therapy in the hospital, and may relapse. The drug's taken away and up comes the disease all over again. Well it isn't the patient that's refractory. The physician should be patient with the patient because the patient wants to get well. The trouble is that his bacteria -- a few, lingering, resistant ones, may have suddenly developed and flared up again. And what it takes then is not the same dose of the old drug, but a very greatly increased dose to mow down the resistant bacteria. Or better still, a new drug to which the bacteria that are resistant to the old will still be susceptible. And in the population of bacteria in clinics now, well we know that there can be plotted distribution curves of the incidents of resistance -- relative resistance. There are some highly susceptible. Some resistant. Some intermediate. And this is a story which is being followed along very intensively now days. In the field of microbial genetics, it's possible to elucidate the mechanism by which the mutation and the selective pressure in trying circumstances may bring out a resistant, new kind of pathogen which is a menace. It takes a new drug then to get after it. And it is easy to study this really and plot it with methods of the statistician to show how the mechanism operates to produce new, dangerous microbes. So it's a race between the microbe and man. And trying to keep things under control. We have a bad landing slide, but here, which illustrates the fact that a whole list of purified antibiotic substances listed here on the left on a screen. And very low limits of each of these drugs were sufficient to inhibit the parent strain that from them we derived immune or resistant microbes, which now will withstand 1,000 or 2,000 or even up to 100,000 or more times as much of the drug that their ancestors would have been inhibited by. So it is a great problem, which is being faced by the clinician and by the investigator. This is not only an aspect of the work which presents a challenge to find new drugs, and which is a nuisance to the physician who had almost cured the patient, but not quite. Here come the immune-resistant bacteria. This can be a new tool in the hands of the investigator that --
