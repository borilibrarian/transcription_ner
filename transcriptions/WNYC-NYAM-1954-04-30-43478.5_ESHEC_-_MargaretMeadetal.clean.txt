>> Ladies and gentlemen, may we start the second day session of this conference. As you see by the program, the presiding chairman is Dr. Benjamin Paul, a man who has contributed brilliantly and most appreciatively to our Eastern States health education conferences on previous occasions and who has been selected to preside over this morning session precisely because his competencies enable him to do not only an excellent job of introduction but also a commentary, et cetera. I have however come here not to praise the chairman, but merely to introduce him. I do want to make one brief announcement and this is a rather important one. With regards to the afternoon session which is the workshop session, it's an intricate process which we have in mind. Its success depends entirely upon your cooperation. Will you therefore, as you go out for a luncheon, pick up a little packet which is available for you which contains the materials and other relevant substances around which the workshop will be built. I'll give you a chance to follow the contributions of the four speakers as well as to prepare for questions, comments, et cetera. But we are very eager to have this workshop a success and your efforts in that connection, of course, will more than assure of that. That's all for the moment except to take you that we will have coffee at 11 o'clock, I'm sorry to say that we cannot provide you coffee this afternoon, so drink two cups this morning, so let's carry over.

>> Good morning.

A good book says among other things that Jesus sat at the right hand of God. Now when the word was being communicated to people in different lands, the missionaries have the problem of translating this and other statements into Chinese and other languages. In traditional Chinese culture, there is symbolic meaning attached to the right hand and to the left hand just as there is in western culture but it isn't the same. In traditional Chinese culture, it happens to be obvious to them that the left hand is associated with the rising sun, with the spring, with the male force, with the side on which is located the residence of the crowned prince in relation to the ruler and many other things associated with the left hand. And so, when the translators of the Bible, in an effort to be faithful to Holy Writ, in Chinese, put Jesus on the right hand of God unwittingly but inevitably. They left the impression in the minds of Chinese people that somebody much more important than Jesus was on the left hand of God. Now, this was one of a lot of interesting examples of culture and communication that had to do with the Bible and the Chinese and I shall not mention anymore. Whether our translations have to be into Chinese or into lay language or subgroups or whatever the case is, if we have a message, we have to translate it and it has to be received by people who receive it in terms that they understand. And this is true whether we're aiming to salvage the soul or to save the body. And this is what we're talking about this morning. When we have a session on culture and the problems of communication, our organization for this morning is that you will hear two distinguished speakers one after the other, at which time we hope at about 11:00 to have a break for coffee. And following this break, Dr. Sol Tax, whom you already know will lead off with a commentary-based on these talks of the early part and general discussion here will ensue. Our first speaker be able to speak on the problem of cross-cultural communication is Dr. Margaret Mead, the American Museum of Natural History of the United States and in a scientific and communication sense of the world. Dr. Margaret Mead has been known to you in many contexts. She has written many scientific books, many of which have been read by the public. I want to draw attention to one that is particularly significant for this audience. She has been the editor of a little volume put out by the United Nations in a series of tensions and technology series called, "Cultural Patterns and Technical Change" relevant to this audience. It happens unfortunately that this useful volume has sold so well that it is nearly unavailable at the moment. It may be got at the United Nation's workshop. But fortunately for us--fortunately for us, we will get some notion of the kind of material that is contained in here from Dr. Mead herself. Dr. Mead.

>> Mr. Chairman, I see that our chairman's mind is already working forward to this afternoon on the use of the word "workshop" for bookshop. It's United Nation's bookshop that may have copies of this book. Last week in a Texas household, I went into--somebody said, "Do you want to come in and take your things off?" And I went into the master bedroom and went to put the--and put my hat on the bed, which is where in the culture that I belong to, you normally put your hat when you go into master bedrooms or whatever bedroom the family had been able to tidy up to the point where you can put things. And my hostess immediately said, "Oh, don't put on the bed." And I was very much surprised because this is a superstition that I had never met. And I talked about it the rest of the day to people trying to figure out what had happened. And it appears that two bands of superstition, I imagined both pretty weak had met in this household and gotten strong. It's an old superstition in show business, I understand, never to put your hat on the bed. And it seems to belong to a branch of show business I haven't been in. And it also apparently is a superstition in certain parts of Texas. So, if you're both a Texan and married to a man who've been in show business, the bed got to be a place you couldn't put a hat on. Now, I'm going to talk this morning about the extremes of cross-cultural communication. You know, I don't like this. All these things are between me and the audience no matter what I do. How many of them work? All of them? This one, this one and that one, all three isn't give me much help. I could do this, this and this. Probably in another few years, we're going to have a sets of mirrors and things to compensate for this kind of stuff but we haven't got there yet. And all you have to understand is that I don't do it on purpose and there's nothing I can possibly do to change it. This morning, I'm going to talk about the extremes of cross-cultural communication, and that is this a volume on technical change that we've just worked on. It's devised for people who are going abroad in most cases to work in Burma or Thailand or Africa or Iran trying to alter or help to alter the health practices and other practices of the same sort in societies very different from our own. Now, some of the people in this room from time to time may be doing just that. But most of you are concerned right now with problems in our own society, so that we might ask why you want to hear anything about these extreme cross-cultures that you're probably not going to go to Burma or it might even be claimed that you're probably not going to translate the Bible. And if you were, you would need the extreme sort of caution that our chairman's introduction gave us. I might add that in Bali, the left represents evil and that you know automatically that anything that is on the left of anything else is bad which would have been another complication. And a Balinese have extreme difficulties in educating that kind of children because you would handle everything of this unclean with the left hand and everything that is clean with the right. And after the point that you decide whether a child is or is not left handed, you and the child lead a pretty terrible life pulling hands in and out like this and trying to stop it. Now, you might say that you're after all dealing with Americans in America and these extreme instances are not going to be except very relevant. They're primarily relevant in pointing up the problem dramatically because it is much harder to tell the difference between New York and Texas, between second generation Italians and second generation Italian-Americans and second generation Polish-Americans. Between Southern Negro populations living in New York and Northern Negro populations living in New York than it is to tell the difference between ourselves and savage in the depths of New Guinea or Africa or between ourselves and Mohammedans for instance. And any kind of Christian and any kind of Mohammedan usage is easier to discriminate the difference between Methodist and Baptist. Although at some point, the difference between Methodist and Baptist may become crucial, usually water is that point. So, that in order to highlight what the kinds of communication that we have to have in our own society between small groups, between regional groups, class groups, religious groups, groups with different foreign nationality background and even between ages because ages in this country are becoming cross-cultural groups. We're going to put this soon. And I think we have to have counsels that which will be called inter-age relations and which will follow the same pattern that we've had to follow within the racial relations. And you know what? For years, we've had meetings with editors to persuade them not to mention the "race" or "nationality" of criminals. And a great many newspapers do not and will not mention the race of a criminal except by interaction, but at least will not put it in the headlines. However, any crime committed by anybody between the age of 10 and 20 today is highlighted in the way that crimes committed by racist who were at a disadvantage used to be highlighted. Teenager commits crime, 13-year-old teenager commits crime is one of the common statements now, as if people couldn't work that one up for themselves. So, that we are beginning more--I think more acutely at this moment when we haven't got very many other immigrants to worry about, so we've decided to worry about subversion of the teenagers. We're going to have a problem in cross-age communication which is comparable in the fact that there are regularities that can be learned and understood and used for translation with cross-cultural communication at a much more extreme level. Now, I won't be able to spend time this morning giving you an infinite number of examples. I'm only going to give a few, first, a problem like hospitalization. And with the public health program, which includes past early hospitalization, preventive hospitalization and hospitalization for delivery of pregnant women. When we attempt to introduce this in cultures very different from our own, we run into a very large variety of problems. For instance in Burma, it is exceedingly dangerous for people to be far enough off the ground so that other things can get under them that might endanger them in any way. And a raised hospital bed is a menace, you can't tell what's under it. Now, the raise of hospital bed, of course, is a fine introduction and it was finally, we've introduced in health education to make it easier for the nurse so she doesn't--I mean, in hospitalization, to make it easy for the nurse so she doesn't break her back.

[ Pause ]

But even the course of not breaking her back, she has a patients that's paralyzed with fear for the things that may be under the bed. This may be a very potent reason for people not coming into hospital. This is a simplest, smaller sort of mechanical thing. One move from this very simple sort of point is a point that pregnant women and women at the point of delivery may need special kinds of food which is maybe totally incompatible with the hospital diet. They may need to observe certain taboos connected with their own lineage or with their husband's lineage. There are elaborate things that must be done with the placenta or with the cord, for instance, among the teeth. When the placenta is buried, it has to be watered everyday with the water from the baby's bath because--and it has to be buried in a special place. And if the placenta doesn't get watered with the water from the baby's bath, the placenta withers. And as it withers the child withers and the child dies. Now, this is a belief that is important enough so that if it's neglected, the mother may go into a depression, may lose her milk and all the things that go with extreme fear in the hospital situation. On the other hand, if the hospital starts planting placentas in a flower pots and watering them with the water from the baby's bath, the hospital is becoming a part of it to a system of belief that is incompatible with the sort of medicine that is trying to introduce, so that you are faced with--and this is problem that we're facing all over the world now. There was a period in--and this period is also fairly important in health education in our own society where the thing to do was to find out to how peculiar the ideas were of the people you were working with and then fit your ideas into them--into theirs. It was called the use of sacred text and rituals in some international discussions. And it was regarded as quite reasonable, if you could get people to drink medicine for the wrong reasons. Fit it in, you see, but get--and get the medicine into the person, get them into the hospital. And there would have been people who would have advocated a very few years ago that all you had to do was to create flower pots to plant the placenta in which were convenient and hygienic, organize the bath water, bottle the bath water and carry it to the flower pots and go on with this particular sort of usage. Now, this is an extreme case. I don't know that anybody advocated this particular thing. But this is the order of advocacy that might have occurred a very few years ago. Now, we're beginning to realize the changes in practice which are made in general frames of reference where the people accept them without understanding can be exceedingly dangerous. And for instance in one part of Africa, the mother has to drink all through pregnancy a concoction of a particular plant that is associated with their husband's clan. These plants are as far as it is known harmless. I mean, you know, it's like drinking ivy leaves and buttercups or something, and chopping them up and drinking them at intervals doesn't do anybody any particular harm. Although the minute that one had an expert going and take a look at the nutrition and medical practices one would have to test them to be sure. But as far as it's known it's drinking buttercups and daisies. If you're married to a buttercup, you drink buttercup and not too much of it. And this worked all right until at some point, somebody got the idea of getting somebody to take a cathartic under the heading of drinking infusions from your husband's clan. And then, the general practice of drinking cathartics instead of the infusions from your husband's clan spread so that you had pregnant women regardless of the need for a cathartic, drinking cathartics regularly in response to this old ritual. Now, this is an extreme case but this is a sort of thing that can happen. We had a very nice illustration of it in World War II and a very widespread one. American women had been told that your babies need oranges. Oranges will save your baby's life, without anybody ever bothering to tell them anything about vitamin C, why they drank full just--but just oranges were good. And there were beautiful pictures of oranges and pictures of healthy babies and oranges and oranges and babies went together. They were also told these were both extensive propagandas carried on by the agents of large fruit industries. California fruit growers did a very good job on oranges. And the United Dairy Council did a very good job on properly pasteurized, sterilized milk. Feed your baby milk that has come in a bottle. Again, both these points were perfectly solid and perfectly good but they were bidding. They went without adequate education in rural areas as to why you drink pasteurized bottled sterile milk instead of taking it out of a can and running down to the corner with a tin can and bring it back. But just bottles are lovely. Look at the bottle, look at the cow, the bottle and the baby and they go together and have bottled milk. Now during the war, some less desirable members of the society thought of a way of making money, which was to sell something that looked like orange juice in a milk bottle, probably selling these orders. It was all over the country. It was made of sugar. It was an entire sugar and a synthetic citric that had no food value whatsoever, and it was sold to the mothers nicely pasteurized, sterilized as far as they knew. I mean in a lovely bottle had delivered with the milk, the babies liked it much better, and in many instances, drank it in preference to milk and, of course, in preference to orange juice. Here was your orange juice. Here's your orange juice for the baby. It was something that was just like milk in a milk bottle and it was terrific hazard. Now this, I think highlights as sharply as one could highlight it, that the attempt to fit one of our practices into an existing pattern without adequate explanation of the basic reason for the practice in the end may be exceedingly harmful. You may think temporarily. And before World War II, we would have said, "Well, it's just an effort to get women to feel that they ought to feed their babies bottled milk," that's fine. I mean, look what were doing for the country if they know they ought to have bottled milk and if they know they ought to have oranges. But they didn't know why they ought to have oranges and they didn't know the point of the milk. They didn't know that the milk bottle with synthetic orange juice in it conveyed absolutely nothing to them except it was expensive and it was an excuse for the public charge and the more for this particular stuff. So, that as we face these extreme contrasts of cross-cultural [inaudible], we have to consider what it is that we are going to teach the other people. Now, it works the other way around too. For instance, you'll find people that have--do a great deal of ceremonial bathing. Their houses are swept and garnished for ceremonies. People always bath before a ceremony, any type of religious ceremony. They wash their hair before a religious ceremony. So, it looks certainly as if these were really clean people. In common, this was not one of the things that the cross-cultural health communicator has to worry about because we don't wash our hair before we go to church and we don't wash our hair before anything. I mean, most women don't wash their hair before they have a baby here. So, if you find people that wash their hair before they go to a religious ceremony and bathe completely and change all their clothes and brush out the house, well, you can relax. These are people that have the proper kind of attitude towards cleanliness. Anyway, you can concentrate on something else. But if you don't know the childbirth is unclean and as childbirth is ceremonially unclean, the midwife will not wash her hands before she delivers the child because this is in clan clean ceremony. You can be totally misled, you see, and think that you're in very comfortable water when you're in very difficult water, where you--we have made a false identification that people appear to be cleaner than we are but where and how and for what reasons. The Balinese take baths all the time but they don't take bath to get clean. They can take baths because they like taking baths. And getting immersed in a sort of a long dish--ditch by the wayside and singing grand opera for 15 minutes. It's not a particularly and necessarily cleanly operations especially if not other people have bathe in that bath lately. And so, that watching the--fact that the Balinese take three baths a day is no guarantee again that they are clean. But are--We would have it--In the particular ways, it would be relevant to the spread of disease. And yet, we would be very likely to feel that where you had to be bother less for the people that took three baths a day than you did with people that took one bath a day. So, there's continual danger across identifications that don't work. Where we take our expectations, transfer them to the other society and interpret something that they do erroneously. Now, one of the striking things that we do ourselves all the time is to think that anything that is white is clean. That is a fixed belief of the American people, although germs are, as far as it's known, not so lightly--it's so brightly color that you can see them on anything. But if something is white, if you have a restaurant with a white table and it's being swabbed over by a dirty rag, it's clean. Everybody knows it's clean, the minute they see the white table. And if it's a brown table, they know it's dirty. You have to do a great deal more to a brown table to get it clean than you do to a white table. And during the war when we were testing out the acceptability of dehydrated foods in different parts of Europe, the Dutch simply looked at dehydrated foods that were brown, they're always brown theoretically, and said we've suffered too much to eat anything that color. Now, so that one--we have a set of problems where we have to deal with a navy usage which is a antithetical to some sort of practice that we wished to introduce, hospitalization, prenatal examination of the mother, a special kind of feedings for the mother, a special sorts of provisions against contamination or against contagion. We all--We have cases where there are practices that we cannot use but which exist. And therefore in some way, we have to deal with them. Now, the way to deal we would say at present with this question of the watering the placenta, that as long as the mother is still believes that is important, the thing it is necessary is to let a relative deal with ceremonially with that placenta and take it away. And if you leave it in the hands of the people themselves, they are likely to invent some ritual device. A little bit about what are ones that they carry off and they work with so that the hospital doesn't become a part of a system that is not compatible with what they're going to work with later. This can be worked out. Now, we faced in setting up this manual a big basic problem on whether what we should try to do in cross-cultural education, having said that these adaptations are dangerous and that you have to watch them both ways all the time. Question then was, should we teach people they are bones of our scientific knowledge without any of our practices at all? And is there any reason in the world for teaching people that white is clean when it isn't? Or should we instead teach people something about what clean does means, because otherwise, you teach a midwife quite easily to boil water but she doesn't see why she shouldn't put her hand and to see if it's hot enough. You can continually teach pieces of our practice and with the reason being left out, you get into difficulties. Now that of course happens here too. I remember when I was in college, six of us had scarlet fever and we were put on the top floor of the dormitory and sheets soaked in for maldehyde hang over the door. And we had three nurses. And not a thing was allowed to go out of there. We weren't allowed to write any letters and we can only telephone and most the elaborate precautions were taken. And we had a Christmas tree because we were sick over Christmas. And we wrote a long poem to the doctor. And we hang the doctor--the poem on the Christmas tree.

[ Laughter ]

How we hang the doctor on the Christmas tree? It would have been good, wasn't it?

[ Inaudible Remark ]

The doctor--We hang the poem to the doctor. I think we wanted to hang the doctor. I think it's probably right. We hang the poem on the Christmas tree. The doctor came in, took the poem and read it and put it in his pocket and walked out. And everybody sees those practices everyday that because we relied on ritual practice, and that even the ritual practices that have been developed in our own society in connection with the scientific knowledge that goes with the practice. The ritual breaks down every time that some small bit isn't accounted for. And it maybe a great deal safer to try to teach people a few basic points about possibilities of contagion, of contamination and of cleanliness, than to rely on a large number of rituals that never cover every event and are likely to be reached at any given moment. The alternative however, if one only gives the bare bones of our scientific practice and no ritual at all. The other possibility is to give enough of our pattern so the rest follows. See the one--Now, let's consider for a moment what happens with wiping your nose. Most savage people wipe their noses with their fingers. They're very quite efficient like a whoop, and then they put the mucus somewhere, different places in different society, sometimes in the hair, sometimes on a post, sometimes on a leaf, a variety of places, some of which are reasonably sanitary.

[ Pause ]

Maybe a leaf that then gets thrown away which is all right. If there are people that are also afraid of sorcery, they maybe pretty careful because if somebody could get hold of this mucus, they could saucerize it. If on the other hand they're not afraid of sorcery and have on the hole of rather genuine affections ranking that comes from their own bodies, they may simply put the mucus somewhere else on their own body. Now, you put clothes on such a people. They go to school. They become educated. They're going to be typists and clerks. They come to work in offices in the capital of the native country. And that is what we hope they will be able to do. I mean we are aiming at now bringing native people as rapidly as possible into a state where they're mobile in the world. And at present you are not mobile in the world without clothes. And it also is becoming a point that you are not very mobile without trousers. On the whole, western men have a tendency not to respect men who don't wear trousers. And if you're going to move in international circles, you have to wear a trouser. That raises other problems I'm not going to bring up to you. So, that you were clothes. All right. Now, the minute you wear clothes and come in and work in an office, what do you do when you have a cold? Now, one thing that you can do next is then to rely on that when you get a dress, you get a pocket handkerchief. This is one possibility. And so, in New Guinea, in the areas where for instance the girl guides still wear dress skirts in many places and a whole group of potential girl guides who got themselves organized will arrive in seven canoes at Port Moresby in dress skirts and say, we want to be girl guides. They have to organize women's clubs and tell people about pocket handkerchiefs as well as dresses. But once you get work--go from the dress skirt. And then, a wonderful thing about a dress skirt is that anytime any bit that it gets contaminate, you break it off. So, all problems of menstruation and other types of cleanliness and blowing your nose can all be solved by just breaking a piece off, there's lots and lots of it. It's very full and break a bit off here and a bit off there. And I expense you to make another one. And if it gets a little worn down, then you get another one. And so, it's hygienic properties in many ways are very high, much higher thank cloth until cloth is properly organized. But the minute you get the dress, you got to have the pocket handkerchief. You have to have the pocket handkerchief for the feelings of the people in the office. On the other hand, we all know that the pocket handkerchief is a menace. And the people continually reinfect themselves with pocket handkerchief. Now, one of the things that we are attempting to do in international cross-cultural work around the world is to therefore if possible shortcut the pocket handkerchief and go from dress skirt to Kleenex and see, with no pocket handkerchiefs in between. Now, this is a model of what can be done in very many places if we are careful enough. Because what's happening in many parts of the world is that instead of going from the dress skirt to the Kleenex, we go from the dress skirt to cloth that isn't washed, to cloth that is washed but without soap so that it looks horrible and you can't really tell whether things are clean or not. A cloth that is wash with soap to a dress, to a pocket handkerchief and years later may be the Kleenex. So, that we're condemning large numbers of people to infecting themselves in ways they wouldn't have done otherwise, just so that they can be as civilized as our grandmothers were. Or you get the same sort of thing happening. I remember in Georgia, during the war, I met a doctor there who came forth up and he said, "Dr. Mead, I've got something to tell you. You'll be terribly pleased with." He said, "You know, they still have squatting childbirth down here." But I'm getting him to bed. I'm getting him into bed. And I said, "You know, in London they're getting them out." But of course, everybody was going to have to get into that in those beds and be born in a good old traditional 1902 fashion and then they're going to have to get out of bed into hospitals then they were going to get at out of hospital beds into other positions. And then, they were going to have to reinvent natural childbirth and go through all the steps. Now, one of our problems continually is to shortcut the steps if possible. And at the international seminar on mental health and infant development that we held in 1952, one of the principle problems was for the very advanced nations, in this case, United States Britain who are most heavily represented. To convince the least advanced nations that a great many of the things they were doing were better than what the most advance nations had been doing. To try to keep the Burmese and the Thai from building thousand bed hospitals. With large nurseries where the babies would be isolated from their mothers, to let them start with what we call roaming in here that we have had to fight a pitch battle with every set of health authorities in the country. To get the baby back anywhere near the mother. You know, we call the baby--we call it roaming in, the baby who is--for the right reason, they'd be roaming in a rather definite fashion. If it's anywhere near it's mother now, it's a roamer in. And it was an advertisement for bread in California recently with the picture of a baby on it and said, "Your star border." Now, there is the possibility that in the course of cross-cultural communication, if we make a good enough analysis of the existing practice and are conscious enough of the most advanced practice we have, we can shortcut a large number of the steps in between that were associated with our past but are not necessary. Of course, the same thing is true of any sort of practice like three meals a day. When the preliminary conference for world food and agriculture organization was held, the American papers came out. They were in favor of this. This was a novel, novel aim. And they said three square meals a day for everybody in the world. But there isn't a slightest proof that three square meals a day is a good number of meals to eat, that everybody ought to eat them. There isn't a living bit of proof on the subject. But we eat three square meals a day. The square is fine you see, but the three isn't. And we transmit the three along with the square, and in many cases do quite disastrous things. So that one of the important points we hope is that by a sufficiently careful analysis, both of our own practice to its bare bones and what is the point? And to the practice of the other people to its--into its actual constituents at every point. So, that you not only know people take a lot of bath but you know what they do when they take a bath, of why they're taking baths and what occasions they don't take baths. And we may be able to transmit the core of what we know at its most modern and most developed stage and skip all the stages and therefore bring people very much more rapidly into the world and into our kind of hygiene that would have been possible. Now for example, 25 years ago, when I studied the monus in New Guinea, they had a complete in New Guinea. They had a completely spiritual theory of disease. All disease was caused by ghosts who are punishing you for sins of one kind or another. The ghost stole your soul stuff. The diviner divine, what sin you've committed or if you were conscious, you confess and your relatives confess for you. One of their duties was to keep a good eye on you so that if you were unconscious, they could tell what you've done. And after you'd confess, atonement was paid to the ghosts that were annoyed. You promise that you would build the house you hadn't build, pay the debts you haven't paid or pay expiation for having made an obscene remark to somebody else's wife and you got well. The major disease was malaria. And one of the characteristics of malaria is that you do get well temporarily. You also get sick again in three weeks or six weeks and then they can have another say ons and suggest you have another sin. And they were utterly uninterested in medicine of any sort. When we gave quinine to our own boys, we gave it to get everybody's opposition and objection. Now 25 years later, these people are completely receptive to medicine. They have experienced--They had an enormous American army who went through. And today, a native would come in and say, "I've got malaria." And if you offer them quinine, they will say, "But haven't you any adoprine? Haven't you any [inaudible] or product that, you know, works better for me?" And they are very contemptuous of the old prewar remedies. And their medical assistants are learning to use sulfa and to use penicillin injections. However, in the course of this 25 years, they became Christianized and they now have a rather idiosyncratic version of Christianity that they have worked out which includes a modern version of the relation of sin and disease, which is that if your mind and soul is in a wrong state, the medicine wont' work. Now, if I had--this had happened 25 years ago. And they had talked to the average doctor or talked to someone who was in touch with the sate of medicine 25 years ago and had said to them, "What do you think because these people want the truth? These are people who believe there is truth. They believe we know it and they want it." And so, they would say to me, "Now, what do you think? Do you think that if so, you think we're right when we say that if someone is consumed with anger and fury no matter how good the medicine, they won't get well?" Today, I could say yes. 25 years ago, I would probably--I'm not quite sure whether I would have said no I'm not. I might have said probably there's something in it. But the whole science of psychosomatic medicine had been developed and we had a theory that quinine got you well no matter how much your hated your mother-in-law, which would have been far less comfort than it is now. So, that we're continually working with a series of changing the relationships between the state of our own scientific information and state of the culture of other people as the old midwife--or not a midwife, I guess she was--no, probably I imagine a neighborhood nurse who was doing a little nutrition education once said, "You know, for years and years and years, I climbed four or five steps to tell Italians not to give their children tomatoes. And I have to climb all those steps again to tell them to get it. Now, that position in this country is highlighted and is much sharper in other countries. Now between ages, between regions in this country, between classes, we get the same sort of thing. For instance, there's a very good study has been made about who stay sick when they go to hospital by Jordan [inaudible] and Martin [inaudible]. And if you are a husky member of the working class who was not used to being confined, who was not used to staying indoors, who has an outside job and likes to go out with the boys, if you get into a hospital, you recent it, you get well as quick as possible and you get out. But if you are a deprived lower middle class housewife who has never had any fun and has never stayed in bed in their life in the morning, and because she's too neat and too orderly and too well brought up and too conscientious and she always gets up early and does her hair at once and washes behind their ears and goes down and put the [inaudible]. She'd done that for 25 years and she gets sick and goes to a lovely hospital filled with such nice educated people, who are the sort of people she always did prefer to associate with. She stays sick. She stays sick for weeks and weeks. She's in a place that she wants to be. Now, this is right inside their own society, inside a small sector of our own society. And the people may be cousins. They may even be brothers or sisters, one having fitted into one kind of economic background and one into another. And the difference is they need to understand what's going on in this groups is just as pressing, although it's a little harder than it is. And this cause more extreme groups that I've been talking about. And it's possible that we would add and I don't think it's--I don't think that's too much to say it's possible. Undoubtedly, we can do a much better job or communication, the more we understand of these differences, the more and--to end on an age point. A typical thing about the United States is the children no more than parents younger and younger. And that children of five now understand a great many things that their parents do not understand, a great many more things that their grandparents do not understand, and unless we understand what they understand. What their views of drugs, their views of antibiotics, their views of--and understanding of health and cleanliness are. Most people over 40 that are trying to talk to children of 10 are fully as handicap as many member of this room trying to talk to people in the middle of New Guinea.

>> The differences in culture that apply--across the world apply in the different scale but equally domestically. And she has told us that it is important in any event to know how the people involved interpret what their doing for us to be guided intelligently whatever a point of policy. It seems to me an unusually fortunate circumstance that our program this morning is so well arranged. If we go by a happy transition to a consideration that is squarely here within in the United States which concerns health education and which involves all of the same principles. What do we have to know about what the people know for us to do intelligent work educating with respect to mental hygiene, mental illness? Dr. Shirley Star, who will be our next speaker, is now the senior study director of the well-known organization NORC called National Opinion Research Center, headquartered at the University of Chicago, that that organization and Dr. Shirley Star have conducted numerous researches along the lines of the evaluating different action programs. One of the surveys that have recently been made not yet to the point of publication or general dissemination has to do with what the public thinks about mental illness. I'm now happy to introduce a person who is a sociologist and a social phycologist, involved both in theory and in practical work that relates squarely and directly to health education here in the United States, Dr. Shirley A. Star who will speak to us in communication impedimenta, assumptions and believes. Dr. Star.

What I have to present today is in the nature of a case study. A case study of the present status and problems of education in one field of health, as Ben said, namely mental health. As I'm sure all of you're here know, the mental health area is one where really extraordinary amounts of time and attention and effort have gone into and are going into attempts to communicate to the general population. Some of the basic principles of the field such matters as childbearing, dealing with emotional difficulties, effectiveness in your own and your personal relationships, things of this sort. And at the same time, these more technical communications go on in an atmosphere where the mass media pour forth all kinds of relative materials, whether these are intended to instruct or amuse is sometimes difficult to determine. But you have advise columns and the soap opera plots and move into which features psychiatrist and all kind of self health both, it's just to name a few. And it's a field where often the various communications at the various levels are across purposes or in frank contradiction. There's been a glowing feeling among the serious practitioners in mental health education that it was merely time for careful stock taking in the field, time to see where they stood, time to thing again about what it is they're trying to do and time to examine how well the means they are using are really adapted to their ends and what modifications and approach might be really called for. As part of this process of self examination and self evaluation, the National Opinion Research Center was retained to carryout a thorough research investigation of the present status of public knowledge, thinking and belief about mental health problems. This research which I've been directing for the center and is finally drawing to a conclusion after four years of really intensive work. It has a point of view and an approach to problems of public information and education that is really completely in harmony with what we heard yesterday and today from Dr. Mead, about problems of communication. There was a time and it's not really too long ago, when public misinformation or lack of information on any subject in the world was either implicitly or explicitly regarded as entirely negative thing, it was a simple absence of correct information. And just like a vacuum, it would automatically vanish once the fresh air effect started blowing. So, the public education programs conceive to themselves as having the relatively simple task of simply making sure that the relevant information was generally around and circulating. I won't relay for this point because I don't think there are any of us here today who any longer give it much credence. And since they are on the record, a number of spectacular failures of a numerable attempt based on such premisses that aimed to instruct to improve the public. Mr. Chad's [assume spelling] yesterday referred to this Cincinnati study which after six months of intensive effort haven't change anybody's mind about anything that is only one example of what I mean. Now, our study of popular thought ways in the mental health field is only one of a number of researches which now take as their starting point instead of these rather simple notions. The basic premise is about communication that has been discussed here. Essentially, we have two premises. First, that before the intellectual content of a public education program will be accepted and incorporated in the popular thinking, there must be some motivation for people to learn it. And that means essentially to change the way they have been thinking because we can be sure especially in the mental health field that people have been thinking about human behavioral long before there was a mental health education movement. The second premise which is even more obvious is that this education learning change process requires meaningful communication. We simply take it for granted now that the only way people can understand the content of what he said to them in one of these programs is in the context of what they already know or believe or assumed. And that in turn, and this is probably more crucial, the only way educators can know what meaning will be attributed to their material and derive from them. And the only way that you would like and intelligently shape their material so that they will actually communicate to people what they intended to, is in by themselves understanding the complex systems of belief, attitude, values, which they're really not so passive subjects are bringing to the communication process. And through which, the new communication simply must filter. Similarly, we take it for granted that the only valid motivation we could learn or to change must develop out of, just as it must be utilized within the same context of the prevailing motive thought. That is unless develop some discomfort with their ways of thinking. Unless the thought system has left over difficulties, things like questions which just can't be answered satisfactorily or conclusion which are often painful to live with. Then, they would have very little reason to discard this old motive thought and very little motivation to pay any attention to the content of any education program that is trying to modify their views. Even thought they educated themselves are highly motivated within the context of the educators on more words of thought to make these changes. So, both these premisses lead us in a research way to examine as carefully as we can. The structure and content or the prevailing popular modus thought about mental illness and about human behavioral generally because it's a higher distinction to make. In the conviction that this is the kind of analysis which will contribute data so that communication can be made more adapted to their purpose, and so that intrinsic motivations coming from the public themselves can be found. As I was turn to a summary of this research which incidentally is based on a detailed analysis of extended interviews with 3,500 people who were cross section of the adult American population, I have to emphasize two cautions I've been misunderstood. First, in trying to solve my own communication problems, I am generally implicitly or explicitly comparing this popular view of points, the way people reason about things with the more familiar to me scientific canons of logic and usage and view point. This is an essence of cross-cultural comparison and the gulf is often as wide as any example that Dr. Mead cited today. When I use words like confuse or inconsistent or illogical or incorrect as I have to, I do not mean to flow into the ethnocentricity of ridiculing, belittling or expressing contempt for popular throughout voice. Popular thinking does depart for technical thinking in a number of important of ways. And it is simply easiest to describe the ways in which they depart by contrasting them with the characteristics of technical thought systems. But in making this contrast, I do not mean to imply the popular thinking who have should or ought ever to be an exact copy of technical thought systems. I hope you will bare this in mind. And in much of the same way, I hope that nothing I say today will be interpreted as evaluating, criticizing or judging the programs of mental health education today. In the first place, whatever we now know about the public's information and beliefs in this area, we have absolute no way of knowing what they might have been like in the absence of the mental health education movement. And more important rather placing or blaming, which is not my function in which I am not really qualified to do, I am seeking only to present factually the enormous and difficult problems of communication that is involved in attempting to replace traditional and almost sacred doctrines of human conduct with views that are more in consonants with the outlook and data of modern phycology and psychiatry. And now that I've made these declaimers, let me start by saying that even research on popular thinking about metal illness is to set by communication difficulties. The contrast between scientific and popular approaches to these problems was highlighted at the very beginning or our study. When we first began to think as this kind of research always thinks, in terms of the kind of question, we could put the people in order to draw forth their beliefs and opinions. Now, to make sure we're asking meaningful questions in this system, in this kind of research, we usually look for ways of asking question that will carry the same, meaning to all people, to whom we're going to ask the questions. Or if we can't do that we at least would like to know just what meaning each person is giving to the words we use. And as it turned out after some months of exploration, we were simply unable to find any word of any concept within the field of mental illness which conveyed the same meaning to even a majority of the public. Instead, we had to adopt a really laborious and lengthy approach to getting each person in the sample of 3,500 to define these terms for us. That is the first thing we did in this study was to ask each person, "What do mean by mental illness?", so that we would understand when we answered later questions about mental illness, what it was he was talking about. So, we started off this attempt as I say with the question, when you hear someone say that a person is mentally ill, what does that mean to you? Now, most people have great difficulty verbalizing at all about a concept like this. But we ask additional questions like, "Well, what does a mentally ill person like? Or how he act? Or well, what does he do that tells you that he's mentally ill?" And after a number of such assist, almost everyone can ultimately be lead to talk in terms of the characteristic of a mentally ill or traits or symptoms or behaviors by which they recognized this mentally ill person. Some of this description, it appears that a spontaneous level when this first question is put without any clues or leads, about half that probably spontaneously equate to mental illness with psychosis, although of course the public would never use this term. But generally, they speak of the mentally ill as being insane or crazy or nuts or out of their minds. And they talk about such characteristic as extreme unpredictability, impulsiveness, lost of control, extreme irrationality, legal incompetent or such symptoms and these are the most frequent violent behavior and coherent talk, and less often delusions or hallucinations. For something just under half the population, initial reactions to the meaning of mental illness include reference to the area of neurosis or too emotional and personality disturbance as even more generally. But the emission of less extreme manifestations from their conception of mental illness at the beginning should not be taken at phase value either. If you ask very directly whether they mean to identify the term mental illness with insanity to use their language, the majority would say no to this, it's just this is the dramatic thing they think of first. The key term in the non-psychotic mental illness syndrome is recognized by the public as nervousness of course. And in one way or another, about two-thirds of the American population does recognize the kind of disturbance of mood or conception of self or interpersonal relations that do characterize the personality disorders. So at first sight, and this is after about 20 minutes of talk with the person, it appears that a majority of the American public does distinguish roughly between insanity on the one hand, nervous conditions on the other. Now, if this conclusion were accurate, which is it not, public knowledge are the meaning of mental illness and their application of the term to human behavior might be regarded as roughly approximating professional usage. The fact is however, that although people can be pinned down to the more inclusive definition of mental illness by this line of explicit questioning, they never stand by it or seldom. That is whenever they're encouraged to talk about mental illness without--at the time pressing them immediately for the definition of the term. They slip back into a usage which corresponds to the original spontaneous identification of mental illness with psychosis. So, by stand points of scientific logics, as they define the term in one way and use it in another, you have to get inconsistently and their logic. For example, a person will say that a nervous breakdown cannot be regard as mental illness because a person can have a nervous breakdown without being out of his mind. Even though they have just said that mental illness includes more than being out of his mind. Or a person can say, and this is one of favorites, that a nervous breakdown is not a mental illness because when you get well you're no longer sick. Although that he had said that mental illness is curable. Or similarly, people will distinguish between non-psychotic and psychotic mental illness on the basis of such criteria as curability. And yet, a sort to the nervous breakdown is not a mental illness because it's curable or because it's temporary. In different way of a very similar sort of paradox emerges, when we get away from this abstract discussion of metal illness and ask people to apply their own conceptions of mental illness to a series of description of sick persons, with the health of a large number of psychiatries we cooked up really description of paranoid, a simple schizophrenic and anxiety, neurotic and alcoholic a compulsive phobic personality in an instance of childhood behavioral disorder.

Now, it isn't fair to talk about this without giving you some idea of the material that people would react into. So, let me read you one of these descriptions. This is a paranoid. Now, I'd like to describe a certain kind of person and ask you a few questions about him. I'm thinking of a man, let's called him Frank Jones [assume spelling] who is very suspicious. He doesn't trust anybody and he's sure that everybody is against him. Sometimes he thinks people he sees on the street are talking about him or following him around. A couple of times now, he is beaten up a man who didn't even know him because he thought they were fighting against him. The other night, he began curses his wife terribly. Then he hit her and he threatened to kill her because he said she was working against him too, just like everybody else. There is the description. For each of the people described, we ask the public to indicate whether they considered there was anything wrong with the person like this, what it was they though was wrong. What they thought was the cause of sequence which had develops this personality configuration and whether or not they would classify this particular instances mental illness and why. Now, when people stop talking and they ask if they can come down to these individuals and whom incidentally they can often foresee tendency that they see in themselves or another who are close to them, there's a remarkable inability or maybe there's an unwillingness to recognize mental illness. Of the six persons described, only the most extreme violent paranoid is diagnosed as mentally ill by anything like a majority of the public health as three quarters of the public. In every other case, it falls way below 50 percent of population down to about 6 percent for a compulsive phobic. Even when the person who has been described by us corresponds rather closely with the image of mental illness which the person has voluntarily given us, the tendency is always to reach out for new reasons why this hypothetical person should not be classified as mentally ill rather than to apply the implication to their original definitions. Now, I can quote illustration after illustration to indicate this kind of shifting of ground and the consequence self contradiction by our logical standards. But if you will accept the remarkable fact that all been about 6 percent of the American public gets involve in conceptual difficulties of this kind in the field of mental illness. I think I can spend my time more probably by raising some questions about why this form of thinking has come be so pervasive. To answer this at all and this is the method we using the survey, we try by inference to tease out from what people have said, what their underlying assumptions and premisses and beliefs about the nature of mental illness or human behavior must be. Even though they do not make them entirely explicit, they're not always even aware that they are using them. You have to supply certain premisses if what people say is to be put in order and make sense. You cannot assume that what both beliefs have no sense. You look for a logic which makes sense. Now, I'd like to sketch out in no particular order and without a lot of numbers, what some of these leading premisses are. One of the first is a very widespread notion that mental illness represents a continuum of inevitable development. It's not merely that some mental illnesses are more serious than others or even that some mental illnesses may develop into more serious. And rather the idea seems to be that all mental illnesses of whatever form are inevitably growing towards psychosis and now inevitably arrive at this stage unless something is done. The position is very similar and is often postered by an analogy from physiology which I think is fallacious although doctors in the audience can correct me. And that is if you neglect the cold or turned into pneumonia. So, since for almost everyone on mental illness is tending toward psychosis, it becomes relatively easy to forget the beginning stages and to identify the whole continuum with the end point so that finally only the end point is brought up when you think of mental illness, that is psychosis. Now secondly, the word mental in this phrase mental illness had to cross several view point which just to add the confusion. One of this for instance has a strong tendency to identify the mental with the intellectual. It then becomes necessary logically. In regard mental illnesses, disorders in which the purely cognitive functions must be impaired. There's viewpoint is really implicit in the thinking of people who tend to equate mental illness with psychosis. For them, the essence of mental illness resides in these qualities of their rationality and unreasonable behavior in the like. And so, they say things to us like this. A lot of people who are nervous, they're mind is as good as they ever was or she knows what's she's doing so her mind can't be affected. Another difficulty is more than somatic problem. Since the people who use mental illness and in disturbance of their cognition, it do not generally mean to imply that some other thing would be establish to cover the other disorder that we might include under mental illness sentencing, the emotional disorder like neurosis. Rather than [inaudible] seems to be if isn't cognitive isn't mental, if it isn't mental it isn't mental illness. So, one consequence in this viewpoint and that the serious one is kind of belittling of any disturbance short as psychosis. Anything else can be reviewed as emotional difference or a character difference and it's non-problematical, it's to be dismissed for some sort statement as, "Oh well, we place all kinds of people to make a world." Or probably the standard statement [inaudible] that we hear over and over again is, "There's nothing mentally wrong, he's just not adjusted," or, "There's nothing mentally wrong his just got a little phobia," and so on and so on. The technical terms are taken over with no appreciation of what they imply within the technical framework. So, we get emotional immaturity use in that dismissing way, it's just emotional immaturity. He just didn't grow up. A thirdly though, the word mental also has consideration to which involve people in mind-body dualism. And this is psychosomatic occurs, these are not--it doesn't in practical thinking to an extent yet. And people are often involved in now in difficult philosophical or either with questions. You know, asking themselves, "Is it physical illness or is mental illness?" I think first asking yourselves is it illness or is it not illness. And then their asking, "Is it physical illness or is it mental illness?" Now, as they can perceive the causes of a given person's behavior as somehow physical, then this perception of cost tends to determine the diagnosis. Now, combined with kind of behaviorism and interpreting behavior that is prevalent in which I'll touch on later. This approach manages to subsume a great many things under the physical Since this man who is fishy and just suspicious indestructible, he can sometimes be conceive as hard of hearing and the personality trait regarding from the deafness and this is part of [inaudible]. And the dilemma of this kind of very behavioristic dualism is best there is still that that will happen when we get around to the nervous system. I didn't quickly understand it myself but I think probably what people think. And some of them argue that the measured system is applied of the [inaudible] in an individual. And that for a nurse, this is reviewed as a physical malfunction into another system the fact [inaudible]. On the other hand, the nervous person is viewed by others is including the brain. And to a really [inaudible] of going behaviors, mind does but at least term for brain. Now this position would tend toward the conclusion that nervousness is a mental illness, it's the brain, if we were not for the fact that these physiological or physical processes are so central. Now, this often leads to a compromised in which the nervous system is elevated to the status of a third major order of reality. On the one hand, it's the physical and over there is the mental and somewhere in between is the nervous which is not quite physically to understand but it's not quite memorable either. And this solves the problem for some people. Now, a related kind of dualism about mental illness really makes mental illness the residual or unexplained category in the explanatory system which is generally applied to human behavior. Rather, it's for many people to say that a person is mentally ill is simply another way of saying that there's no possible way of accounting for the behavior of this person except by postulating mental illness. Mental illness then becomes a kind of clausal explanation, which is not it self to be further explained and which is used in the system to account for anything else which is left over and can't be explain by the rest of cause of variables. Thus, people will say thinks like, "Well, he had to be mentally ill because I can't think of anything else that would make him act like that." Now, when this view point of mental illness as unexplained residual category is combined as it unusually is with this broad all kind of empiricism which assumes that concepts and theories capture all of the already completely. Mental illness becomes residual and still know this sense. In this view, mental illness is what is left over when reality is subtracted. Now, reality to this behavioristic empiricist is always external to the individual's consciousness. The psyche is not real. Sometimes he hasn't even permitted to have psyche. So once again, any behavior which can be trace in reality and this in essence meaning that the physical organism which for psyche inhabit or the environment which surrounds the whole thing, anything which we can be cause which retrace to environment or physiology is not mental illness, it has real causes. The essence of mental illness then and this is a quite widespread idea on reality. Actions, beliefs, emotions or what have you, a mental illness only to the extent that they're on caused by reality people. People say, "That's only normal. It's only in his mind." It's a dismissing approach again. Now, with this way of mental has confusing adaptation and association, the word illness also in that without its difficulty. Much of this discussion of mental illness that we hear goes on by rather hasty and not always correct analogizing but physical which is much more familiar to the people. So, it should not be surprising that consideration of what is or what is not illness are actually derived from the realm of the physical. Now in essence, a physical illness might be regarded as something which pathological for the organism. And generally speaking, it's the presence or at least this onset is signalize by a change in the usual state of the organism, his temperatures goes up or his pulse falls or the doctors in the audience, they can say this better than I. And finally, this kind of consumption of illness, people find it very difficult to view as mental illness, anything which could be regarded as a chronic manifestation of personality, the many things which might be subsume under the category of character disorder. If a person has always been this way, he's not mentally I'll. If the same behavior is novel, not usual to other person, that is mental illness. People that are often will keep for a few and dramatic manifestation sudden collapses, psychotic breaks and any kind of equilibrium appears non-problematical as long as it's running along. On the other hand, there's also another way at looking at physical illness. And this is one in which the condition is defined as pathological not because it isn't the usual condition of this--of the individual or because it isn't the usual condition of the species. However, customary it is in that individual. By way, the illustration I'm thinking are going to the metabolic disorders where for instance a person may always have an [inaudible] shortage that's normal for him in one sense but it is known because this is normal for all people. Now, this two use of illness are rather easily merged in physical illness because most frequently--most illness as you can think of, what is not usual to the species is not usual to as thing on member of the species either. But they read really different outcomes when they're applied to mental illness. So according to the species do, that is what is usual for the species, it can't be illness. And really with the liberal reinforcement, and I think I misunderstood that in terms of culture of relativism. Whatever behavior is widespread among the people, common to many of them simple cannot be viewed as illness, thus, for many people, one of the persons whom we described who really approximated one eye is famous statement of the neurotic personality of our time. He can't be mentally ill because he is so characteristic of our time and this is accepted as the norm. Another one of this general health formulated premises which entered into this discussion mental illness, is the fact that really considerations of moral responsibility are always being important usually by the back door. Generally, in the form of assumptions about freewill or self-determination or self-sufficiency if you prefer. In its simplest form, you see this in people for whom mental illness is epitomized by loss of self-control. More typically however, loss of self-control is again combined with this mind body dualism, so you get a view of self-control or more popularly willpower is a function assignable to the mental whom rather than to the physical. And so, any impairment or weakness in willpower or self-control is by definition mental weakness and mental weakness as mental illness. More important however, these guys and just individual always is or could be, or should be accountable for his own actions. Automatically makes mental illness a term that's used to blame or excuse individuals for their short comings. There are lot for example, many people who say things like, "It isn't manliness because he could snap out of if he really wanted to." Willpower. Other people do call these things which they see as weak and morally comfortable mental illness but only because they use mental illness as the correct deficit for stigmatizing such tenancies. Thus, we get people who feel that certain behavior on mental illness is because they are within the control of the individual and there others who are essentially even more critical of the presumed personal weakness expressed in the behavior who refuse to extend what they regard as a sheltering term illness to defects of characters. They will say there's no excuse for humanity in that way. That's not illness it's just a no good low down and so on. Now, when essentially more of you to disorder can't combine with other considerations that we can see them with the reality across or the nature of illness, a very kind of decision emerges in which there are certain kinds of average behavior which can be viewed as chronic manifestation of personality again. Now, these are chronic in the sense that they did so ingrained in the individual or to the outside is control. And if therefore the behavior can be viewed as a function of heredity of personality or temperament or basic character structure, and of this even in turn is viewed as something which goes too big to be offered in the individual's life time, then it would not be mental illness. People who think in these terms make it quite clear sometimes. But the dominant consideration is a sort of supporting consideration or what is and is not fair play. That is mental illness is really a term of approbation and it shouldn't be assigned to individuals for matters which are not actually their fault. For instance, one person set up the paranoid man I described, I wouldn't say he was mentally ill because may be the poor fellow can't help it because it was born in. Quite similarly, the emotionally disturbed child is often, very often regarded it's not mentally ill because and it's the logic I wants that's there. Because his parents can ultimately held to be responsible for his antisocial behavior, he's described as a true identify and a few more things. Now, as a final one of these tenancies, I think it's important to know quite exclusively that what the prevailing mode of accounting for human behavior is. It implies the scheme and I'm afraid I'm using noncommunicating words which is highly behavioristic, it's mechanical, it's rationalistic and it's very naively empirical. Primarily, people are looking for direct concrete immediately perceivable connections and experience between the behavior and its causes. Then the frequent tendency because of this is to think in terms of causes which correspond very closely in common sense experience with the symptoms or the behavior that's to be explained. And there's little or no awareness or attention that lead to symbolism or a rational fact as in behavior. A few illustrations I think may make more clear what I mean. Take for instance this paranoid which described the suspicious in distressful and exactly quite hastily toward other people, now the most usual more of accounting for such a person is to assume that it sometime in his life, he has genuinely been the victim of persecution and justice of treatment betrayal and get this in the most elaborated vergence, his wife and his best friend went off and so on. And so, that he was justified at one time, at least to that time and between the people who were actually against him. Now, from this kind of condition and then it's a raw conditioning theory, he has seen to generalize this view to all people or sometimes people really regarded as he has over generalized. He had poor judgment enough to drop from one instance in over general conclusions. Now, the schizophrenic girl who was described as extremely withdrawn and empathetic is almost always perceived as an instance of naturally in convincing to sociability.

Either her parents didn't teach her to like people as if it had to be taught or they failed to push this rather back with child into social activities or to counter act what is assumed to be an innate withdrawing tendency. Or the one reason or another where the badly motivated or leaning well, they severely limited or social content. Now, if their people don't need this line of explanation, then it must be that there's something about her. Her parents, her knowledge, her talents, her personality that led to rejections and robust in her earlier social relation and she's been taught therefore one way or another. She either hasn't been taught to have them or she has been taught to avoid them. Or take the girl whom we described as compulsively going back who checked a gas stove and a door and who phobically avoids elevators. Almost always, her behavior can only be explained by referring to experiences which involved exactly those elements. She has learned to go back and check because once she didn't, then there was a fire, or she has learned to fear the elevator because when she was on an elevator accident and now is afraid of them. Occasionally, people take this one to great fear that she felt, that didn't have to be an elevator it could be a fire without a gas stove. But it doesn't go any further than that. Out of 3,500 interviews, we had three people who explicitly said that maybe her behavior didn't have any [inaudible] whatsoever that go with the usual social meaning of doors or gas or elevators. Not in a way, the essence of such explanations on human behavior is they're superficial reasonable illness. They really check against to why people have experience life in their highly external observations of others. When they're caring into the realm thinking about mental illness, however, they have logical difficulties again. If on the one hand, behavior is to be explained at all. I see that today's manners were [inaudible] as regard concern I'll speed it up. If this behavior is to be explained at all you see.

[ Laughter ]

Is it too fast?

[ Laughter ]

Oh, I don't intend to stop until I finish what I want to say. No. Oh, you see you get into this problem where--If they're going to explain behavior at all, it's regarded as a really very reasonable response to these life experiences. The implication is it had this experience happen to any human being he would have respond at the same way. On the other hand however, it may simultaneously be regarded as mental illness. And the essence of mental illness is for this varied people, unreasonable I must say. That is behavior which is inexplicable not related to circumstances. It's irrational, it's unpredictable, it doesn't confirm to this reasonable cause effect scheme of people use. And this is a major dilemma and some people recognize it. The only way anyone can solve this however, is to use another one of these assumptions that we've mentioned. The rigorously logical person who would use to this notion of mental illness as a residual category which is not to be explained simply denies that anyone of these people for whom he has been prevented this quite reasonable explanation is mentally ill. That's why so many of them are not perceived this mental ill. Others however, reintroduce these notions of free-will on personal responsibility. They establish the behavior as mental illness because the individual who is having this reasonable reaction has deliberately carried it to one reasonable minds. Now, it is mental illness because it's like self-control, you see. In either case whatever happens the emphasis is always, always, always uncontrolled on rationality and human behavior as the crucial elements. I think it's obvious, even from this very hasty review of them, how anyone of these more prevalent underlying assumptions can function as serious impediments to meaningful communication of modern psychodynamics or the interpretations of vast of the human behavior. When these theories are offered to the public, what happens is either that much of its significant is ignored as irrelevant. It doesn't make sense. You know, it's much easier to regard her as frightened by an elevator than some more symbolic interpretation. I can think of one of hand. Now, the other thing than happens is that it's completely distorted, and so it losses and I say distorted now in the sense of change from what the communicator meant, so that it will fit into this system. Or else it's simply rejected out right as I suggest as any form almost better than that. Because what people believed about human behavior is regarded as a well-established soft evident truth. The popular approach to human behavior is not really saying, "We don't know anything, tell us." It's based on an assumption that everybody knows people. And if you offer an interpretation that frequently contradicts, what everybody knows to be true about people, this is the basis on psychiatrist regarded this. Now, the peculiar for the remarkable ideas and nobody can make sense of. With the wisdom of hindsight, it now seems to us that many of the substance of findings of a later section of the study that I can't go into, beliefs about other aspects of mental illness could have been logically deduce simply from knowing two of these defamed grand premises. If we take only the really irrational claiming to an insistence on reasonable missing rationality as the central quality of human behavior and combining that with the really highly more realistic approach to human behavior which pervades this concern with freewill and who is ultimately to be blamed for what? What would have to follow about other beliefs? I'd like to illustrate if I may in about four or more minutes with some beliefs about mental illness and with some popular orientations towards psychiatry. First then as I've already suggested, there's a consistent tendency but a little bit seriousness and deep seated nature of neurosis and emotional disorder Schroder psychosis. And there's an equally consistent tendency to exaggerate the seriousness of psychosis. The general approach to emotional disorder schroder psychosis is to regard them as usually and easily curable. Their treatment is typically regarded as a very simple, unspecialized not very time consuming operation which the individual could carry on for himself or might equally well be done for him by his family or of his friends or ministers or doctors or psychiatrist, there's really no distinction everybody does the same thing, whether the emphasis is on self or an assistance from others technical and nontechnical. The assumption underlying almost every form of treatment mentioned is that the neurotic individual unlike the psychotic patient is able to profit from rational advice. Since he is presumed to be able to act rationally and recently, and this is the desirable thing, any failure on his part to accept the advice and to profit from it and to act rationally is a matter of his own free choice. And you have a right to stand back and morally disapproved of them. It's now accident then that these neurotic problems are always almost always viewed as moral problems. And although the technical term neurosis has not been incorporated into the popular vocabulary of any great extent, the few people who have acquired it and who did use it in our interviews in interpreting human behavior use it far more often as an empathetic especially mora of disapproval of an individual then as a term referring to a category of psychiatric disorder. This morally changed approach pretty kind of madness really which offers relatively little motivation toward taking an interest in or feeling concern for or acquiring even some other mode of understanding the person with emotional problems. Where the sick individual is viewed as having made his own bed and is capable anytime he wants to of unmaking it if he cares to, people are quite justified in condemning him or pitying him. But what need is there to feel any concern for him. He's able to take care of himself. On the other hand, the psychotic individual has lost his rationality. And given this underlying premises, he has therefore lost his crucially human quality. He's dangerous. And it is dangerousness into psychotics which is very widespread is not merely a problem of the overplay in the press of physical violence on the prior of exculpation and so on. But many people believed that all psychotics are going to burst out any second now. And many people put it in these terms. But if you look just a little way underneath what people say or running through what they say, they're actually expressions or the kind of anxiety generated and people with over rationalistic biases. When they're forced to deal with people whose behavior is not to be understood or controlled by this rational means applied in everyday life, over and over again, the element of danger finally comes down to be. And the language of the person talking, this isn't a great guess, that you never know what he's going to do. They might do anything. How can you tell? It isn't the physical act, it's the uncertain. Rational individuals just simply cannot be expected to understand or deal with the irrational. This is the conclusion not mine. Unlike neurotics, psychotics always call for the services of specialist and they can best be cared for an institution even when people have an exaggerated notion of how bad the institutions are, they still want all the psychotics there. In this way, this great threat of irrationality can be excluded from society if not from the consciousness of these people. The whole subject as everyone knows is surrounded by an almost [inaudible] with that of superstition and taboo and fear and dread and avoidance. It's almost enough to state again that many people view psychosis not merely as known as irrationality but it's known as it cannot even be approach rationally. To sum up this underlying fears, as summarized from commonly how beliefs and attitudes many people view psychosis as an illness whose causes are not only not known, but whose occurrence cannot be anticipated fully or cannot be prevented and whose onset may be initiated with no previous warning by some everyday experience that nobody can really avoid. People generally feel the ones psychosis occurs recovers impossible or at least very infrequent. And at those who do recur--do recover, never do so completely, they always show some signs of their former illness and more important they may relapse in any second again without a moments notice. The typically recommended approach to former patients is therefore to be summed up as [inaudible]. If they cannot be avoided, they should be handled with care unless they explode into psychosis again and expose you to irrationality. If I may be permitted a really editorial comment, I have no data. It almost seems that people must either resolutely ignore the problems raised by mental illness or radically revise their faith in human rationality. Now finally, and I mean it, there are implications in this popular view points for the public status of psychiatry as the field which specializes in these disorders. Psychiatry occupies at the moment a very peculiar position. It's apparently more accepted than it is familiar and it's certainly more familiar than it is to understood, very little is actually known about psychiatry, its magic and its mysterious. Except, people know it exist although often they have arrived at the fact that its existence has a logical deduction from a knowledge in medicine. People will say, "Well, they have specialist for everything else, so there's must be a doctor per heads too." And the publics approach by and large stays at this factual level. There's very little enthusiasm for psychiatry, very little open hostility either. It seems not unreasonable to suppose. So, the psychiatry has a few which is offering assistance to the morally weak on the hand and the threateningly irrational on the other. It's to some extent going to share in the kind of stigmatization rejection and avoidance which characterizes proper attitudes toward the patients themselves. Beyond this however, the fact is the people for the most part quite content with this common sense of reasonable approaches to human behavior except when they begin to pinch. It works well enough for everyday problems. So, they don't really themselves recognize logical inconsistencies in their throughout way of thinking. And they don't often. For the most part, although you've seen many troubled people if there's minor fraction of the population actually. They don't often feel fully need to understand themselves or others more than they do. The outcome however of this public emphasis on rationality and on externals and behavior, and on freewill, on self determinism is a view in which psychiatrists are implicitly at least denied any specialization. What they do for a person with a problem, I'm speaking of non-psychotics now, is a no way different from anyone else with the time or interest might do for a person with a problem aside perhaps some such [inaudible] or narcosynthesis. The point thing that these are busy times, so anybody could do this but nobody has a time so we have specialist to do it. The prevailing doctrine is that everyone understands people. I cannot emphasize that too much. And in so far as they have correct understanding and everyone has, they would proceed in exactly the same way in dealing with the infected person. Therefore, in the absence of information to the contrary it is really assumed that psychiatry upgrades with the same interpretive scheme of human behavior that the public does. The widespread assistance of an assumption like this and naturally a psychiatrist would view as a person just like I would together with this real act of felt need to understand more in a consequent real ignorance about psychiatry, this ensures that the basic conflicts between psychiatric and popular theories of human behavior are kept at a minimum level. The challenge to popular expertness of psychiatric theories really imposed and the ensuing kinds of disagreement and hostility that would result are always minimized because nobody is aware of it. At the same time however by being just like everyone else, psychiatry is left with little claimed to expert knowledge and therefore a little claimed to public respect. Now, I'm sure that in this quick summary, way it adds up to a very negative picture. And the true fact is that many of the most cherished belief of our culture in western culture generally combine to offer the most formidable kinds of resistance to the spread of doctrines whose acceptance paradoxically enough would ultimately relief human beings from some of the burdens imposed on this psyche [inaudible]. This kind of adherence to extreme standards of rationality, self discipline and personal responsibility, it's just because the human cause are so great and the implications to this way of thinking so punitive to so many individuals that I'm convinced with more careful examination, the mental health educators will find openings within the system to break through.

As our lead of commentator, I'm happy to reintroduce to you the man you already know Dr. Sol Tax.

>> Thank you. And since you do know me and have heard me, I propose to speak very briefly and I will ask the Chairman if you will listen to cut me off no later than 10 minutes if I forget myself because I intend to speak less than that. Yesterday, you all remember that we talked much about listening rather than talking but we didn't get a chance up here to listen to you. Today, we would--I think we ought to. Besides, there isn't very much that I can say what you can't just as well say after the two very brilliant presentations this morning. The--I think and a whole somebody while we were having coffee suggested that the whole conference is really saying one thing that we should find out what goes on in the persons mind. So, that we can plug in better into it and in order to educate him, I added over coffee again and would like to add here again that we shouldn't only do this for the sake of being able to educate him. But because we might learn something from him, otherwise, I don't want to be quite so utilitarian and say that we should plug in as a means to some other end but it might be worth our listening just in general. And this it seems to me is one lesson that we ought to draw in general if we can. Now, there was who? Dr. Mead and Dr. Star reiterated this major lesson in different ways, that is that we have to learn what other people are thinking in order to be able to do anything in the way of education. The two new things that I've heard particularly from Dr. Mead was first that we need to give the full reason to the people. In other words respect their intelligence and attempt to give them the full reasons why we want to introduce a change to make the assumption which I believe firmly that anybody can understand anything, that the treatment as I said yesterday as adults who are capable of understanding. But she added in order to be able to do this with the limited time at our disposal, let's not make everybody go through all the mistakes that we went through in our own development. And we can short circuit the whole thing not by not giving them whole reasons, but rather by not giving them bad practices to start with and they have to cure them out of. Now I remember, the best documented case of technological change of this kind is I think the case of Germany which was described by Thorstein Veblen [assumed spelling] in such length in which he showed the advantage that Germany had in becoming industrialized that England did not have. That is that Germany was able to set up a better industrial plant more quickly because it didn't go through the industrial revolution itself. But borrowed it from England and England had all these trouble and had--and it did everything the wrong way of where a Germany could start a fresh and do it the right way. What I understand Dr. Mead to be saying is that we ought to give them that give people when we help educate, we need to tell them all of the things that we've gone through all of the wrong things but take on the most advanced knowledge we have simply it devotes ourselves from our own history and as much degree as possible. And in that manner, short circuit, the difficulties that we've gone through, in other words give them Kleenex instead of handkerchiefs at all. Dr. Star's report of a brilliant research gives us a case in point by--in speaking about the mental illness particularly giving us some idea of how difficult it is to know what goes on in the minds of the American people when we try to deal with such a complicated thing as mental illness or mental health. And of course, since you have just heard it, there is not much point in my repeating it. One of the things which Dr. Star said in the beginning which I would like to emphasize because it is part of our--I think it's part of a general message that we've been hearing the last two days is that the notion that people have blank minds are just waiting for the truth is of course a false notion that is that you have in some sense changed peoples minds. They have something in their minds already. And I think that this needs to be emphasized even more than Dr. Star or anybody else perhaps that emphasized it. We cannot make the assumption that the other person is not a complete function any at all that what is in his mind is a system. It means something to him. It functions for him and so on. And it seems to me that this is the reason why you have to understand to everything, respect everything that is in the other person's mind. And if possible if you wish hook on to it at somebody in Mr. Cass' [assumed spelling] phrase. The hook on to it I think. That's one of the things which I think it needs to be emphasized. But I repeat that we have to understand the other person both for his own sake. The thing that I found most lacking in Dr. Star's presentation or in the report of our research is kind of the assumption that she was right and all this people were wrong. And I were have feeling that maybe if the national opinion research center would think that maybe the people occasionally somehow or rather through the development of culture and culture of history might come out to some truths that an NORC might learn that might get a little better. Now, I do not imply that--or with her disclaimer, Dr. Star, still believes that the scientific view is better in some sense other than the other view. But what I do want to suggest is that--and this is the major difference between Dr. Mead's and Dr. Star's presentations and in fact their research, is that an action oriented research gets you out of this trouble. Dr. Mead, always asking the question or at least in this context, she asks the question of what can you do to educate people or what can you do to change people or something of the start which is the different kind of question than the one that the NORC was asking which was what did they believe about something or what do they think about mental illness. Now, as soon as you turn the question around, what can we do to educate them than everything that you learned from them gets into a conflict of action which keeps you from making the mistake of thinking that they might not be right, because you've got to somehow or rather as it was said, hook into it and you leave your mind open to the question that they probably know what they're doing. And the notion of saying that they are simply irrational and the only conclusion that Dr. Star being able to draw at the end saying that somehow or rather the only way we're going to teach people about mental health is to get them out of the pattern which we know have of being rational and being moral. I wouldn't want people to be less rational or less moral than they are even the American people. And somehow or rather, we've got to broaden if there is something to do. We've got to hook into their present to the contemporary pattern of belief about these things and to see what it is that we can build on rather than what it is that might need to be destroyed. I think the building on to something which is in the culture is in the beliefs of people. If we respect people and if we respect the cultures is--the not only their way to do it but I think perhaps the only way to do it.

[ Pause ]

>> Yesterday, I quoted Webster by saying that one of the functional comment is to gossip. And I want to gossip about that, for me, one of the most important points of cross-cultural communication very modestly, and that is of course talking to people. And I think for people tell that it is very understandable. And they remember during the war have you involved in all kinds of difficult problems and it was really something very nice I mean to get manual books in your hands and to see them. And I still think I mean, what she is doing only already by her writing is one of the best means of coming to cross-cultural understanding. So, want to emphasize that. Another remark I would like to make as an example is that, there's not only a ritual that we--and special such holistic behavior of [inaudible] people we have to take are, there's also a peculiar ritualistic invasion from our scientific work. At the end of the war, we had to take care of famine people. And became as all our scientific prejudices, they have ready famine therapy groups with injections and all kinds of prescriptions. But we have to do--But the only thing that people ask and in different countries and different way for [inaudible] and pleasant until they refuse the injections. And they refuse the famine therapy. And that they first want and that we have to learn rather too late plus cigarettes, coffee and then later on a little bit different food. And of course in here it was a little bit a blow for our own scientific mean. And then one question I had and I hope Dr. Mead can give an answer because there was a peculiar cross-cultural communication in the last war of a [inaudible] during the first war that there's a form of musical communication. During the first war, there were German songs and our British songs and Athens songs special war songs, but not during the last war, those partly song [inaudible]. What is behind this that they all singing the same song at this moment, that is to go home from each other. But that was completely different from the first war. Now, our second speaker because I have to be sure, I must say I admire, I mean, her approach and her scientific as theoretical approach of these problems. Nevertheless, there are some difference you have to call implications. Because only begin to use the questionnaire technique, I'm sure that even on the approach to people with simple problems not the problems of mental health. But for instance their opinion and means you have to phrase and verbalize the opinion depends about the sports car or the Cadillac. And when you think about it, I still think that you will get also a very peculiar impression about the diversity of opinions and how difficult this with them to express. I want to say that because I still think for this audience that is important that we are not pessimistic. I'm sure that the moment of the--our standing for practical problem that the question is are we able in a special case somebody maybe primitive or somebody may go through a little bit behind. But being all those cases, we are able to phrase in a different way so that temporarily we have some understanding. Because I'm the only use a few technique and we asked 10 psychiatrists about the same definitions to say speak 10 different languages. And when we asked 10 different analysts, they come out of 10 different groups and then get also 10 different answers. And nevertheless when we stand for the practical question, we are able to give an answer. And I'm thinking about my last experience. And hope to tell you that because of that question about a man [inaudible] in Korea--and the prosecutor said, "But how is it possible this man was normal? He was writing in scientifically form about the German Welfare and was stating what the Americans have done. And he managed under the school intellect and all those fact in that report. And well, and how is it possible to call this man mentally [inaudible]." And I must say [inaudible] of course the phrasing was very difficult because he have relayed people gruntingly who were able to convince the court that nonetheless--I mean there were all kind of influences which influence this man and that on the same circumstances, we all would do the same mistake. So, I want and that is the only question I plan to ask the second speaker, that it's possible of course to ask the laymen.

[ Pause ]

But another questions is and for us even more important as health education, the question is how can we on a difficult circumstances phrase our knowledge that way that they can communicate understanding and as a result of the understanding promote mental health. Thank you.

[ Noise ]

>> Was your first question to Dr. Mead rhetorical or otherwise about music in the world war if you want to answer that question.

>> I've expect that special enough so might be at around to briefly. And when questions appeared to be sort that other people will also be asking, I think we'll gather them up in a bundle at the end. I would add to this point that you made that the music for "High Noon" was written by a Russian. And that at the same point, that we are having these extreme divisions over the top of the world with this very violent and antagonisms, the world is becoming steadily more one. And then, in World War I, people did feel Nationality at a level that they did not feel in World War II. And I think what they said with Romeo over the [inaudible] for instance in World War II, was they were all in this together. And as the sort of thing that was expressed in the World War I by temporary honest business by agreements across the trenches, but--where people who did face each other for a long time and had truces and sent food over and did all sorts of things was expressed in World War II by music that went around the world in situations for people were not able to express the sorts of things that they expressed in World War I by trench truces on the one hand that they were far more quietly understood, that people of the world are beginning to feel they are in the same vote regardless of the position of governments above them. This is a specialized point I think if you don't want to get it think to in the point to self and get specialized.

>> Dr. Star, we'll wait a little bit in order to be able to answer question here respond to statements made by Dr. Tacson [assumed spelling], presuming to some others that come up. Are there other questions? And let me point out that it is necessary to come to the microphone if you will just state your question and I'll try to rephrase it on the microphone. And if what I say isn't right, just tell it to me. Yeah, question?

>> I've a rather simple question right to Dr. Mead. I was greatly interested in her story about the baby and the orange juice. I gather that the general idea was that we haven't gone far enough and tell these people other than orange juice and baby with certain unhappy results based partly on the advertising propaganda that was used. There's two implications in that. The one is, how far do we go in presenting technical data to people? In other words, suppose we have said that a baby should drink orange juice, of course it contains vitamin C. Have we gone any further? The second question is what responsibilities we all had as members of the health education team in doing something about possibly misleading advertising.

>> I'll [inaudible] that. For the moment, do we still have more questions on the floor?

>> I'll give more question, let me just repeat the essence of these two questions. So, we remember them while it is well that we convey the reasons for behavior. How far can we go in the view of technical knowledge? And if we convey technical knowledge, how much have we conveyed with this? And second, what can we about advertisers and their motives? Are there other questions that we can put on to the floor? Question in the rear of the room?

[ Inaudible Remark ]

>> Thank you. There was a question here.

>> Dr. Star, do you ever [inaudible] general discretion of her sample on instance one to the [inaudible] one as a [inaudible] in the sample on the earth of population coming in the sense [inaudible].

>> Thank youWill Dr. Star, when she makes her comments speak a little bit about sampling. Question?

[ Inaudible Remark ]

>> Interview or written questionnaires, question. Other questions? Let me say by way of transition to the speakers who will answer the questions that have been raised and are being raised here that we have heard and well today what by now most of us quite realized that we ought to know what the other people think and feel. Second, that there are ways of finding these things out although they're not always easy, but perhaps most important of all that when you have received this information, when you have setup techniques for listening and when you now know what the public thinks about mental health or what people in a given group think about high beds or low beds. The real question arises what are you going to do with this information? I was in a village where people all realized that there was no recreation of a certain time present and there was action intended by the government of this--in this area. And two anthropologists who knew the culture very well made opposite recommendation. One said don't introduce a community recreation because its alien to the pattern and the other one said this is their great lack and this is the thing we should introduce. Now this is a judgment that doesn't depend completely upon their knowledge of what you have over there. These are principles of action and what should you do in the program. This was implicitly and strongly raised in the second talk, explicitly raised by Dr. Mead. How much shall we tell? And coming back to the mental health problem there's a real problem should we communicate things to them if we knew how and what should we do and why and what will happen when we do? In addition to the problem, necessary problem, of finding out what do they think in order to receive communication? And may we get this other question on the floor.

[ Inaudible Remark ]

This is a question directed at me but I think equally applicable to both questions, speakers namely in studying what people do we want to know not merely what they think but why they think it. What's the economy function and purpose of their behavior and belief which is very critical because it serves a purpose, and you don't recognize it. You may run into what is easily called resistance, misunderstanding the like. Are there other questions?

>> Ben, I like to say something.

>> Say it.

>> I like to say it right here that the essence of communication always lies in verbatim stuff. Now for instance Dr. Star had to read her paper because it had to be absolutely accurate and detailed. But because she had verbatim quotes it carried as most written papers don't. Now if people stand up and talk about orange juice and you translate it into nice, beautiful abstract language that's what does on that paper or that autograph over there that's what's goes in the transections and we lose the essence of communication. Now I know it's faster. It's a lot faster but I think people should, either you should repeat that question verbatim you see? That I'm all in favor. That saves time. But I don't think you should rationalize the question itself. I mean because the difference between what should we do about that orange juice and the function and purpose of something is miles.

[ Applause ]

>> Question.

[ Laughter ]

>> I just have one quick [inaudible] Dr. Star talking with these people about emotional problems and she had asked is that how, you know, hypothetically, you know, encourage them, had asked them, what kinds of things disturbed them within their own family or in the community or with their colleagues and so forth. Whether she would not been able to get a picture of their concept of behavior that is socially and personally disturbing. I don't think it matters whether everyone knows that this is neurosis or a psychosis as long as this illness study is destructive personally and through the community. That's one question. And then the other is, well I assume and I think I know from talking about this, through Dr. Star, the case study was ordered for a specific purpose to make a study of mental illness. I'm wondering in using this study this, whether the [inaudible], it should not be promote mental [inaudible] mental health rather than inform people about mental illness [inaudible] storm.

[ Laughter ]

>> You get your answer directly.

[ Laughter ]

>> As it happens all the questions are highly related and there are questions that have been thrown at me before. I don't have all the answers. But I can say a few things. Unfortunately I'm at a disadvantage. I didn't get to talk to enough of you and I don't know enough about the health education field. I don't know if a tuberculosis worker meeting a polio worker feels that there's a distance, they're really quite different people doing quite different things in there. But when I looked at this program and saw that it was going to be three social anthropologists and one sociologist I knew I was in for trouble. Now If I can borrow from Louie Hacker's [assumed spelling] autobiographical statement, it's a fortunate thing that I really once inspired to being a social anthropologist so it's a little easier for me than if I would just a straight out sociology. And I can borrow again having spent four years with these mental health materials and read a little psychiatry and began to know how very complex it is and I know that I don't know anything so I'm in no position to tell you whether people are right or wrong. But I do think one concept you can apply to research is that it's like a person. It has a life history, a development and when you get to the end product, you can still see traces of the genetic development of this project. Now if I can be almost crudely confessional, this project began as a service job as well call it in the trade, somebody was trying to do something. He wanted to know how far he was getting and what was left to do. His standards were our standards to begin with. We said, "What is it you want people to know? We'll find out whether people know it or not." And they, the client, the national groups in the mental health education were the standard of what people ought to know. Now after--I hate to reveal myself as a stupid but this is the way research is done. And there's a ritual here too. You do it so automatically sometimes if you don't stop to think about whether this is going to help them or not help them was a technique. They want to know this and you light up some questions and then you find about that, and it ends up very often with these studies. And I gave a paper last week and I don't want to repeat it that you haven't done anybody any good, not the practical purposes of the client, not the research field. its entirely too mechanical. Now we began this way because there was very limited budget and this kind of research is very expensive and we might as well be real class about it. And they thought they only wanted this and it only took a little while and my leanings towards social anthropology to realize that what we were going to get wasn't going to do any good in the world and with their limited budget they should save their money and not do research if we were going to do it to find out what people know, in terms of some fixed standard of what people want to know. Now I say this with great feeling because I feel a little to blame myself. Traces of it still show in the--because some of the paper was written for the client who still wants a point of view that they're right and people are wrong in presentation to their audiences. And I fail to make myself clear. I've seen the pendulum swing myself too often and come back to fork wisdom in a different form that suddenly we discover that rooming in is good for babies. Or I hate to quote medical examples because I don't know medicine but I understand the Chinese use of spider webs on wounds turned out to have some medical rationale although it looked as much like superstition and folklore and magic as anything else. And I sat in on a serious psychiatric conference so we could go where they were quite seriously considering the possibility of prenatal influences.

Well it's [inaudible], it's not so long ago that the [inaudible] was to expose yourself ridicule or laughter. we still have a few people saying it in the survey. But I learn to be very, very careful about [inaudible] guiding the people I want that I agree with the social anthropologist but the important thing is why do they think so? What purpose does it serve, what problems does it solve? And I thought I tried to discuss that. What problems that it need unsolved, what problems would be more comfortably answered with some other approach. It's the matter of substituting one functional solution for another function of solution because there's greater social good in one than another perhaps. And I don't say that I'm the one to judge that if--for instance guardian, psychoanalytic doctrines were distributed really throughout the constellation that any good would come. And if I don't know, there's a committee set up now, it's going to spend two years just thinking about what it is we want the public to know about society. It's a very difficult question. I'd sit on this committee occasionally and I said I don't know anything. I was still on my mental health worker on this committee on fewer researchers actually. And I'm sorry if some early history of the project grows through and more difficult purposes of the project but if you look at it closely, many research project show that somewhere in the middle, somebody realize that what they were doing wasn't good enough and try to make it better. And I only wish I had known more about it where we're doing the study over again. I think the suggestion that came from over here of doing it, it's even more openly. We forced the consideration in mental illness. Now, it's true that when we ask the behavioral questions about people, we were picking typical instances because it's easier to give them an instance and have them react. And we didn't mention mental illness, we wanted to know how they dealt with this problem. What was it to them? Was it a problem or wasn't it a problem? What caused it? We didn't drag in the mental illness issue until quite late so that we do have some of this material. But I'm willing to grant that this broader approach would result in knowing something about a thought system and turn out what its basic categories really are. We forced one basic category that really isn't basic in this system and we know it now. Now, this is because we have a client who was interested in this category. We can't do everything the way we would like to. But I'm convinced and I think Dr. Goldstein [assumed spelling] who was a real student of these theoretical communication problems would agree that when people don't have words, it's a good indication that this is not the way thought is organized in the group. And so the mere fact that we can't find words to talk mental illness about people convinces me the mental illness is not a category of common consideration. Sure they have relatives and institution and things like this but their classification of human behavior, mental illness is an artificial category that we imported into this discussion. We had to because the client deals with mental illness. Now another point along the same line is why don't we build mental health rather mental illness? And this is a technical problem. We wanted to but the profession of mental health education, psychiatry and so on cannot themselves define what they mean by mental health. They can at least define what they mean by mental illness more or less. We tried a few interviews, talking to people about mental health and the only way people could talk to us and really we didn't know how we were going to talk to them unless you say well mental is the absence of mental illness and then you talk about mental illness. Now, I'm aware that that's not a good definition of mental health. I'm aware that it would be better if somewhat positive conception but most of the definition say that mental health is the absence of friction in your interpersonal relation. It's the absence of this. They're really negatively defined even when they're positively defined as I've read and I got to see a really positive statement on mental health. And we knew mythologically, we couldn't talk to people. We had enough trouble with this concept and then that one would have been more markers. There are some things that research just can't do. So, I think that I can--[inaudible] the question that's quite similar, he refers, I think to some of the disagreements apparent or real on the technical side is that a correct reformulation. And we're aware of this. And you get into a peculiar situation when anybody can't believe anything and authorities would back him. And that's one problem of course, there's--who is in authority is not well defined either, that I've been doing a constant analysis about strictly medical advice count and that is indicated that happens to run in the Chicago paper. It's written by an eminent internist and two times a week he gets help on psychiatry and he sounds exactly like any persons chosen at random in our sample, he does not know what he's talking about in my opinion. And he is none of the less an expert who can be cited in support of what you want to believe if you want to believe that. And so we have a problem here and to get autobiographical again, we are looking for the fund to do a companion study of the professional psychiatry. We think this is the other half of the picture and that perhaps if the communications were more persistent. I think I have a few more question. Well, I have to stop there and take up the specific questions. The sample is the national sample of adults, it is representative on any demographic variable you want to mention, if 60 percent on urban in the population and 60 percent urban in our sample. I have a terrible memory of demographic [inaudible] so I can't tell you what percent if anything but I can tell you that a little check with the US census for 1950 in almost any characters you can mention. The approach here uses what we call an open questionnaire and I think there's a difference of terminology. This is a face to face interview using an interview guide which we call a questionnaire providing the questionnaire consist primarily of pages of blank paper with the selection at the top. The interviewer tries to follow the order in which we give the questions to have some control. The other extreme would be on psychological effect, after [inaudible] there's no order. We try to follow some order to make sure that everybody talks in every topic we're interested in but everything is recorded verbatim. I hope I have covered everything.

>> Dr. Mead.

>> The two questions that I would--the word addressed to me that I've got left off are the whole related--I think it related to this problem that was raised earlier by Dr. Tax. Is why do--what is our responsibility in educating other people? On what ground do we decide to do it and how can we decide how much to do and then the important question of responsibility that was raised over here. What is the responsibility of health educated or influencing advertising and so forth. Now, we're running overtime so this is going to--have to sound often categorical. The question of what right we have to change other people's attitude, when we subscribe, under what circumstances is primarily an ethical problem. It has to be referred to our total system of ethic. It is not a question of whether vitamin C is good for babies or not but is the question, how long? But is a question of what our [inaudible] for other people and under what circumstances we feel that any group in society is justified in altering the behavior of any other group. Now, I'll say this very briefly and this will sound categorical but it is one point of view that's been worked out for many years and it a long discussions I have to say in a conference on science, philosophy and religion. There's a discussion and there's cultural patterns and technical change, the discussion and ethics of the society for flight anthropology and so forth to just give you the references that I work with particularly. We assume that people have no right to impose on an adult individual. Any change in their attitude of behavior, unless that individual is interfering with the safety or health of some other person. Now, in our particular society, we regard children as a total charge so that society has the right to protect children against adult. It has the right to protect one part of town against contagious coming from another. But beyond that, the changes in the behavior of individual which do not injure other people, by contingence, by contagious example that is really contagious, it doesn't just give it you with other people's character. It would make them a little uneasy. By war or attack or by violence are something that people should wish to alter themselves which means if you will never tell people how to alter their health, except on the assumption that they themselves want some basic value in this picture that they want to live. And then now, you still have--you may know better how they can live than they do. And then it becomes the question of you're implementing what they want. The safest way of being sure you do that is never do anything two people under any circumstances but only do things with them. And always include on any group under any circumstances the people who are going to be the recipients of your boundary so that they can fix the boundary over. Now, on this problem about how much of a pattern we get, a minimum I would think and this a skeleton just to try to communicate with you and not manage in the statement from uncaught. That is the question of orange juice and vitamin C that we are obligated to communicates to people if it is a point of balance between that. That there are a bound set of things what people ought to eat but no single one of them is absolutely essential even though that maybe the best way to get that particular food because the aftermath of a single statement about one essential food can endanger the safety of millions as it did in China when we insisted on milk. And people who--so the babies were fed on soy bean. It wasn't their food, there was an imitation of milk that wasn't as good food could be made out of water made from vegetables and [inaudible] for the baby. But we have insisted the baby must have milk with [inaudible] milk like that something with white look like milk and so they're called milk. We have to get over the idea of balance, the idea of hidden ingredient that one wouldn't superficial know what they are but are in food. This sort of thing, we try to do with the seven basic groups. The idea of interchangeability and balance and the idea that we do not know them to find those answer that this is our best practice at present and that it would change. Those are the minimum point that if they have been communicated, we would have saved the great deal of trouble during the war on this particular [inaudible] question as a model. So that if we treat people as adult, respect their culture, respect their culture, respect their motivation and protect ourselves from any possible and [inaudible] disrespect but always including them on the committee, enough of them, and respect their intelligence and communicate the central core of what we know at present and always admit we do not know what's going to be done three weeks from now. We have the best advices that certainly a group of us have been able to invent protections against imposing on other people, destructive, partial and coercive program.
