>> Announcer: From the auditorium of the New York Academy of Medicine, your city station presents the first of the new season's Lectures to the Laity. Tonight's talk, the Linsley R. Williams Memorial Lecture, will be given by Sir James Spence, Professor of Child Health of Newcastle upon Tyne, England. To introduce the lectures, however, here's the evening's presiding Chairman Dr. Howard Reid Craig.

>> Dr. Howard Reid Craig: Ladies and gentlemen, as President of the Academy of Medicine it gives me great pleasure to welcome you all to the first of the seventeenth series of Lectures to the Laity. These lectures have been worked up by the Committee, a sub-committee of the Committee on Medical and Information of the Academy of Medicine, and I can assure you that the work of these men has been wholehearted and most serious and they have devoted a tremendous amount of their time from their very busy work in order to produce for you and to present to you this series of lectures. We are very fortunate in our speaker of the evening who will be introduced later. But first of all I would like to introduce to you Dr. Howard B. Keyes, who is Chairman of the Committee on Laity Lectures. Dr. Keyes.

>> Dr. Howard Reid Craig: Thank you Dr. Keyes. Being introduced from this platform is, for me, like entering my own living room and being introduced to my own family and relatives. Literally speaking I live here. However, this does offer me an opportunity in opening this 17th Annual Series of Lectures to the Laity to make certain acknowledgements. First the continuance of these lectures would hardly have been possible had it not been for the enthusiastic support of Dr. Oren [assumed spelling] S. Whiteman [assumed spelling] and his conviction, which is a real one, that one of the functions and one of the duties of the New York Academy of Medicine is to lay before the public in authoritative fashion, the trends and directions of medical thinking and medical progress. To Dr. Howard Brown Keyes, Chairman, and his Committee, goes credit for planning the series and plotting out its content. And finally, the spark plug and the wheel horse if I can mix my metaphors, is the able and resourceful secretary of the Committee, Dr. Lago Galston. To each of these men, the Academy as an institution acknowledges with gratitude their enthusiasm and their accomplishments. At this point it were well if I emphasized again the intent and the object of these lectures. And I think this is extremely important. They're not intended to treat of disease entities, as such, or to treat of techniques or treatments. Their purpose is not to discuss your illness or my chronic disability. They are meant rather to bring to the public some knowledge and understanding of the significant developments in medicine, the direction of medical thinking. And the story of how we have come to know what we believe we know. They also will attempt to picture the expanding horizon of medicine as a social, as well as a biological science. This initial lecture this evening is the Linsley R. Williams Memorial Lecture. I pause here to pay a very real tribute to the man who of all men made this Academy what it is today. A practicing physician. A teacher. A public health administrator. Organizer of and counsel to many voluntary health agencies both here and abroad. He came to the Academy as its first Director in 1924. He brought to this office a rich experience in organization and administration. But more than that he brought a broad humanitarian outlook and a generosity and a warmth of personality which is survived over the 17 years since his untimely passing. Dr. Williams came to the Academy at one of the crucial periods in the history of any institution. When the decision between stagnation and expansion becomes a gambler's choice. Dr. John Hartwell, who was his successor as Director, wrote "Had he come sooner, we could not have fully utilized him. Had he come later, the result would have been neither so happy nor so productive. Had he not come at all, those who know the intimate history of the New York Academy of Medicine know also that a great opportunity would have been lost. And the losers would have been the people of this city. And even of the entire nation." We, of today, of the New York Academy of Medicine, do well to honor his memory this evening. I'm delighted to welcome as our guest tonight another of our colleagues from overseas. Sir James Spence, Professor of Child Health and Director of the Children's Department of the Royal Victorian Infirmary at Newcastle upon Tyne, is one of those individuals with a rich clinical and laboratory background who has seen the vision of disease. Not only in relation to the individual patient, but as well in relation to the individuals in immediate surroundings. Namely, the family. He, with his associates, has studied many factors which bear on illness in the family. Economic, cultural, sociological, and epidemiologically. They have pursued these studies into the homes themselves. Making their observations at first hand. And thereby establishing the validity of their fundamental data. Years ago, as far back as 1918, Sir James Makenzie attempted a [inaudible] in Scotland to study the beginnings of disease. More recently, the late John Ryle at Oxford made studies of disease in relation to the individual's external environment, an area of study familiar to us as Social Medicine. But the studies of Sir James Spence, on the other hand, have radiated from a child health center into the intimate setting of the entire family. I think the broad implications of this approach are obvious. Sir James we welcome you here. But I warn you, we're going to have a question and answer period so be on your guard. It is with the greatest of pleasure ladies and gentlemen that I introduce Sir James Spence.

>> Sir James Calvert Spence: Dr. Craig, Members of the Academy, ladies and gentlemen. I am no historian but I think that when the history of this period comes to be written that the conquest of disease will be revealed as one of its greatest achievements. Now I am not suggesting that the conquest has yet been so great, but we are within reach of a physical Elysium where there will be no more sickness. Where disease will be eliminated. Where all that will be left to harm the bodies of men will be the injuries which come from the machinery which they themselves make. That is, I think, fairly safe to predict. That the variety of the extents of the use of this new machinery will leave us with the trauma, the injury, as one of its results. But by and large, the major pestilences are now under control. Those pestilences which used to sweep the face of the earth. And during the past 100 years we have overcome Typhoid and Typhus. Small Pox and Syphilis. Plague of Kuepel [assumed spelling] Fever. Diphtheria. Dysentery. And that is indeed the limitations by definition when I say that we have, to that extent, conquered disease. But I think it is wise to remember that nature is a very fickle mistress. And we must not be too confident of her submission or of her fidelity. She appears always to have tricks up her sleeve which we mortals cannot very easily perceive. And if I were to continue to use the metaphor of pagan theology I would say that men are still the play things of the god. We are, I think, more inclined to take this modest view, nowadays, and apparent would have been 50 years ago. They were then living in the flood tide of self-confidence. Men's master of his fate and captain of his soul. You'll remember per to the day. But we were then-our fathers were then-elated by the Darwinian Theory of Evolution. And they were perhaps misreading the Theory of Evolution into a belief that all change through physical adaptation was necessarily probes [phonetic]. Now, indeed, we are much less sure about that. Events of the last war themselves revealed how thin was the veneer of our civilization. And we've only to re-read and contemplate those memorable lectures that were given to this Academy of Medicine by Dr. Leo Alexander to remind ourselves that science and morality do not necessarily go hand in hand. And our own generation we witnessed bestial cruelty. Not only as an occasional morbid abhor ration, but rampant and par [phonetic]. We cannot, therefore, in contemplating the advance of science, but feel occasionally somewhat chasent [phonetic]. But I am digressing here. My subject is the physical diseases of men, not the diseases of civilization. They, the diseases of civilization, are the affairs of the philosophers, not of the physicians. Or, indeed, if you care to carry responsibility still further back, it is the affair of the universities to produce the philosophers. And if the universities will not produce these wise contemplative men, whom we call philosophers, or if they won't produce them or if they've forgotten how to produce them, then society must invent new cultural instruments superior to the universities. Returning to my subject, the point I wish to make is this. Why we've done a great deal to conquer disease, and have done so by mobilizing forces and by creating instruments for this conquest, we must constantly be on the alert keeping these forces mobilized. Making new instruments and having them all as at hand. They must, these forces, become simply alerts inclined to see the changing character of disease. And trying to foretell what new tricks nature may have up her sleeve. Now I shall make the claim that one of these instruments must be, at all times, engaged in trying to see disease and what I've called its local setting. That is, disease as it is occurring in a local community. Disease seen against the background of the local economic conditions. Disease as it effects or as it is influenced by local conditions of life. That is, local culture. Now some may call this social medicine or environmental medicine, but I prefer to call it just plain medicine.

[ Silence ]

Now let us look back for a while and see what have been the forces and the instruments by which the control and conquests of disease has been going. And I shall stick here for a moment to the military metaphor and say that these forces have been like three brigades in an infantry division. Or like the arrangement, as far as I remember, of the British Army. Like the three branches of division, A, Q, and G. For I'm concerned of training of personnel and other concerns and supplies and another concern of fighting the battle. By using this metaphor I wish to suggest to you that these three forces, which I will shortly describe, with all their instruments, must work closely together. They may indeed criticize each other occasionally and benefit by that cross-criticism, but in the end they must, in this way, work together. They must know how each other works. Although each has its own responsibility. And in trying to describe what I believe to believe these three forces, which must be constantly mobilized, be aware of what is likely to happen to disease in the community. And must explain that my observations are based entirely on medicine as I see it in my own country. Medicine as I have experienced it in England. And whether or not these observations in the application to any other country I am not prepared to say. Now these three instruments, which is any modern complex Western society, I believe to be necessary, our first, the University in our [inaudible]. I think alongside them, because in some respects the work is so close to a part of the work of a university I would put the big research foundations. And the second category is that tremendous force. The control and the conquest of disease. Namely the medical profession itself. And thirdly, as another instrument engaged in this, I would place quite squarely the Government of the day. Whether it be local Government or central Government. Each of these, as I say, has its own responsibility. But each much adjust its responsibility to fit the other two. And I do not think that disease is likely to be kept in control unless each of these plays its own appropriate part. This means the last analysis. That each must have good leadership. Leadership by wise men exercising wise judgment. It will be no good winning a tactical victory on one front and losing it on the other two. About the responsibilities of the universities and, as I've suggested, the research foundations, there will, I think, be little argument. But it is perhaps probable, occasionally, to remind even the universities of these responsibilities. I think the first responsibility-if it is not going to be too whimsical to define it in this way-I think the first responsibility of the university is to be a universe. That is, a place where the criticism and evaluation of ideas is being continually carried forward. When nonsense can be exposed for what it is. Where the intellectual virtue of sincerity of mind is fasted in the transmitted. The transmission usually being a process carried out by the companionship between teacher and student. The university works and does these things by processes of scholarship and research. In medicine, universities have two other responsibilities. One is the selection and education of men for the profession of medicine. And the other in medicine, as in all the other subjects which the university should be concerned, is the opening out of new fields of knowledge for exploration and inquiry. Why not turn the responsibility of the profession that will again, I think, be little argument. It is responsible for the maintenance of the practice of medicine. The application of knowledge, the skeleton [phonetic] research, and the practice I've mentioned. There are, however, I think, in more detail, two other requirements for the profession. That it shall maintain a professional ethos. A standard of conduct within the profession which the profession sets itself and it should maintain, otherwise it will not be a profession. It should maintain professional freedom, which means, I think in my interpretation, the freedom to do what it ought to do, and the way it considers medicine [phonetic]. Now let me say here whatever divergency view there may be in Britain about the organization of the professional practice of medicine, there is, I think, no doubt in the minds of any responsible person, probably of any political party, that the medical profession should not become a complete salary [phonetic] [inaudible]. It is understood that the profession to remain free and, therefore, responsible, to its obligations should be, to that extent, self-managing. And it is, indeed so, whatever misapplications whatever misinterpretations may have been made, it is indeed so that even under the new health service, it is not a salary [phonetic] profession. Now about the responsibility of the third force, and that is Government, for the control of disease. That may be, perhaps, some divergence of opinion. Some perhaps will say that the Government should keep out of it entirely and leave it all to the profession. And that is, I would submit, at least in my country, would be regarded as a very extreme, perhaps outrageous view. The history of medicine in Britain over the last 100 years shows that Government, indeed, has a responsibility in medicine and in medical care. The argument is not "shouldn't play a part", the argument is "how should it play a part?" How far should it go in playing a part? But I personally take the view that the Government of a country, a modern, complexually organized country, has not only the duty but the right to see that medical care and the control of disease, along with our social services with which it is competent to do, are adequate for the nation's welfare. Now, so far, I've taken a somewhat broad view of responsibilities in medicine, but I must now take a more restrictive view to describe my own experience. My own responsibility in the work I do as I see it. It is, of course, necessarily a local view and a personal view. And if it were, as we say in the laboratories a "hyper [phonetic] view" that it must be remembered that it's colored with my own reagents [phonetic]. It is my duty in the work I do to work with in the field of pediatrics. I do this work as a university man. It is my sole profession, therefore, to be a university teacher, a university researcher, and to do those other things which are expected of a university man. In that I know, and must acknowledge, I feel greatly privileged. And as every privilege in life carries an equal obligation. I must, from time to time, examine my obligations and it seems to be the law of obligations that they go on increasing as one gets older. Now seen in this light, and looking at the need as part of my obligation as a university man to be looking forward to fields of knowledge, which may have to be extended. We can see what a wonderful record, indeed, pediatrics has had. To the science of medicine alone it has made extraordinary contributions. It was first in pediatrics that the application of modern chemistry to medicine was faster. It was through pediatrics that the science of nutrition was at first applied to human wealth. Pediatrics is perhaps among the first of the clinical subjects to make itself to preventive medicine. And nowhere indeed was this better exemplified than in the city of New York at the hands of Dr. Holt, Senior, who played such a part in finding the specialty and the subject. Now in spite of the technical difficulties of pediatrics, the difficulty of diagnosis, which were well expressed by an English physician called Cameron when he said "There is no branch of medicine in which experience is more necessary than in pediatrics, but no branch in which experience is more difficult to come by." In spite of these difficulties pediatrics has indeed advanced miraculously in this century. But this advance has been along well worn parts. The parts of clinical observation, clinical science, careful study of people in hospitals in the outpatient departments. Use of laboratory tests. The use of morbid anatomy, as we call it. The techniques for the prevention of infection either by immunization processes or by the building of kinds of institutions in which class infection would not readily take place. These, I say, would be the well worn parts of clinical study. And the results I've seen, of course, in pediatric medicine. The precision of diagnosis now available in disease. The quicknesses of diagnoses are reached by modern tests. The extraordinary fall in child mortality rate the beginning of this century in big industrial cities. One child out of five would die before the age of 12 months. Now it's less likely to be one out of 400 or 25 out of 1,000 is about the level. Which is another result of pediatrics has been the collaboration of institutes of various kinds and institutions in which pediatrics may be carried out. The third result, one which I think has some bearing on my subject, is the rise in the authority of the trained professional man, the pediatrician, and the nurse. And in a moment I hope to examine but this has not in some fields been carried too far. Now thus we see pediatrics established as a highly technical branch of medicine. The whole army of eager men and women trained to advise women on the care of their children. Sometimes having to carry the responsibility of taking those children into institutions for treatment. And many of these men and women continuing their researches, the diagnoses, and treatment and prevention of disease. And now it is, I think, the time to ask and some of us are asking ourselves this question, where does pediatrics go from there? Has it indeed already gone too far in some directions? Are there new fields to be explored? Are there new instruments of exploration to be invented? Now I have my own attempts to answer these questions. I've turned in two directions. I assume that whatever institutions may be necessary for normal conditions, that is for the treatment of disease which cannot be treated at home, such as hospitals, that the chief instrument for child welfare in modern society is, or should be, the mother. And that the chief instrument of child development should be the family. I'm not again saying the value of the hospital or other institutes and I'm not again saying the various schools.

[ Silence ]

But to develop these latter instance to the disadvantage of the others may indeed be a thing that has to be examined. And I have asked myself should not pediatrics now turn itself to an objective study of these instruments? This that I know is coming very near to anthropology. Nevertheless if pediatrics and public health doctors and educationalists are creating their own institutions they must ask themselves, what effect are these institutions and these instruments going to have on maternal capacity and on family technique, which to me is the same thing as family culture? Are we going to revive Russo's idea that the state or an organized profession of working for the state can do better in the care of the child in the family then the parents themselves? I've only got the suggested to show you that not all Plato's ideas are necessarily good. In my own city we've looked at this. For example we made an objective study into the domestic care of premature children. And we have been able to demonstrate that in the case of all premature babies that-at least those over the weight of three and a half pounds-that is within the terms of the definition between the weights of three and a half pounds and five and a half pounds at birth. At the cost which is one-tenth the cost of institutional care, we can get the same results by training and mobilizing some people to undertake this domestic care with the premature in their own homes than you would get in hospitals. I hear I must perhaps remind you of a local scene in England-which may not be familiar to you here-in my own city. Fifty-seven percent of the babies are born in their own homes but only 43 percent in hospitals. I've also in maternity hospitals and in a hospital which we have created the last 25 years in which mothers come in to undertake the nursing of their own babies through their illnesses so that the child may, so to speak, come from the operating theater and be nursed in her mother's arms. And by studies in the homes of the people we've been making some observations in what might be called, to use a rather technical term, the "filler project genitive adaptations of the mother." Her emotional reactions to situations, her sense of achievement in feeling success for the care of her child, particularly that sense of achievement. Feeling the success of caring for it through an illness. The extent to which this experience and this sense of success brings about her own maturity as a woman. I have heard it said, for example, from some of my colleagues, that they can in a street car talk to a woman on a general subject. Not a two or three minute conversation, noting her responses, say whether she's a woman who's had this rich kind of experience. A sense of success in the bringing up of her own family or whether she has had an opposite experience. They go on to say that the street car is not named desire.

[ Laughter ]

Another interesting study when you enter this, there is almost a feel of physiology, which is capable of studying here. We have noticed, for example, and confirmed by control observation, that a woman who will bear as the responsibility of her sick child. This is more true at home than in hospital. As long as that child is sick and constantly waking, her sleep requirements physiologically fall. To remove her, she may, throughout the nursing of a difficult illness lasting a week or more, require no more than two or three hours sleep a day. And yet be alert in the wake for the remaining hours of the day so long as her baby isn't physically in contact with her. To remove the baby from her presence by staying at the hospital she will found forms of profound exhausted sleep. And now that adaptation we notice is a woman's sensitivity to sound, particularly sound of the voice of her own child, is far greater when that baby is very young, than it would have been hour times or later. And certainly must be within the observation of many of you that it is far greater at those times than as the sensitivity of the male parent.

[ Laughter ]

These are indications of a kinds of study, I think, which need now preliminary observations having been made. To be carried out in the scientific method. And lastly, and quite briefly, I come to another instrument which we have tried to develop. One by which we have tried to see disease, as I've said, in its own setting. That is in its proper perspective. If we were to rely in medicine only in the hospital ward for our observations, only on the outpatient department, only under the boundaries [phonetic], and only on public health statistics, we may be failing to see disease in its proper perspective. Now to do this some five years ago we took a sample of the community in which we live in. It is necessary to get this sample for the purposes we required and the man who was represented or social classes in the right proportions. Our object was limited and quite simple in the beginning. It was to get this class sample of a number of babies in the community. Because knowing as we didn't that respiratory illness in the first year of life, pneumonia and diseases like it, were very prone quickly afterward to produce permanent damage of the lung. We wished out of that sample to take the babies who had had these illnesses, discard the rest of the sample, and study those babies for 10 years following closely by the method of natural historian of the sequence of their diseases and lung diseases might be in later life. It took us a year to design the experiment. To train the workers to collect the sample. To get it. To become intimate with it. And then to find desertions in high number from the sample would have invalidated our results. From a statistical point of view we required about 1,000 babies. So within the inner parish of the city, that is within the area comprising of 300,000 inhabitants, we would expect about 6,000 births a year. So we collected our sample by taking every sixth birth. That was a year of high birth rate so eventually our sample was 1,142. I may here explain that it was designed with such care and done, I think, with such delicacy. And I use that word that we have had only four desertions from the sample of 1,142. Although the experiment did not stop at the end of the year. We became so fascinated in this sample. We became so fascinated with the picture of life as it is lived and the diseases that go on in the families, studied that way, that we have continued the observations and are likely to continue them for another five years. Now what then are we seeing with through this instrument? What can we learn? In the first year, I say, four people deserted. Some migrated and we weren't able to follow, but even that the reasons they migrated from our community and went to other communities is itself an interesting bit of social history. What surprised us when it came statistically down to it was the vast quantity of illness in an industrial town in children. The 1,142 children-54 died, which is the expected number-but 764 of them required medical attention for illnesses in the first year of life. I admit that some of these illnesses may have been transient. A short, febrile cold. But some of them were indeed much more serious. And it did put into the right perspective the different kinds of infective illness, which children in that very sensitive age period of their life, are liable. It showed that the pattern of disease is indeed changing. The percentage, for instance, of infected illnesses in that first year of life was not highest among such things as measles. It was indeed in this field of pneumonia, severe kinds of bronchitis, and what we call acute respiratory illnesses which represented 50 percent of the total illnesses. Twenty-two percent were represented by septic infections and the consequent results. Only 11 percent by the infective gastroenteritis, which 100 years, 50 years ago, 25 years ago, used to kill as a many thousands of children each summer. That is almost gone. Whooping cough, about which we heard so much, was responsible for only seven percent of the illnesses. Measles only four percent. Tuberculosis .3 percent. We were then seeing disease in this way. In its true perspective. I cannot and I do not wish, and this is not the occasion for me to go into some of the technical details of disease and to spread what we call as clinical epidemiology within the families. But it has given to us material for research. To clear in certain instance of why certain families are so prone to certain diseases. And it has revealed to us that very often a disease in an older person, an infection in an older person, will assume one form. A middle-aged person another. An older child, another. And then the baby, another still. However, perhaps leaving beside these technical details, you may be more interested to hear some of the other sides of the study. We have used this instrument to give us a view of the medical services which are available to the community. To give us a view of a clear, precise, objective view of how the people use the medical services. Give us a view necessary to be obtained at a time like this when there's so much emotional conjecture going on about the medical service. To give a view as to how good those services are or are not. We've made a study of the reaction of children to their stay in hospital. I examined how they behave when they come home. That's giving, so to speak, us a backstage view of our activities. But there's one other thing that'll interest you most. There's a study of maternal capacity. How we've had to define this perhaps in ways that may sound to you a little loose. And we use to define a satisfactory maternal capacity. A woman who, living in the circumstances she does, is able to provide effectively for the welfare of her children. Now this requires diligence, intelligence, sagacity, love, and all the other things which go to make maternal capacity. We call those "copers". But the other extreme we put people who are severely defective in whose care is almost unsafe to leave children because of this defect. We call those "non-copers". They are in the ordinary word "sluts" you would agree. It is, and perhaps I may explain, that having cross-divided our sample into the five social classes, which most sociologists use in their categorization of these social samples, that at least one of these sluts is in a higher social class [laughter]. In between that we have two other varieties. One we've called people who are variable in their capacity to cope, and those that are, although not severely defective, dangerously defective, are yet unsatisfactory. Having made this, having become very intimate of our sample, the figures are these. Of these 1,142, fewer now because of deaths and removals, of the women only two percent in the community in which I live and work are in the category of being severely defective in maternal capacity. Seven percent are some extent unsatisfactory but not dangerous. Nine percent are variable. That is with a little help they get on very well. A little good neighborly help. And 82 percent are completely satisfactory to excellent. Now if it ever were possible in social medicine, environmental medicine, or other social sciences, to get a quotient in a community, like this, which represented the true capacity of mothers in the community to look after their children. And were it possible to go on making a graph of that over the years. Or were it possible to compare that index figure in one culture with another, and one town with another, I think you'd have an instrument to tell you where your civilization is going.

[ Silence ]

That I profoundly believe that culture or the techniques of culture made by men and then transmitted by women. And this perhaps study, which started off with a simple inquiry, defined why the lungs of babies were so readily prone to be diseased, has ended up with a picture of a community. It's a way of living. Its culture. Its attitude towards institutions, which I think is making for us teachers who have to teach medical students a picture which colors very much our teaching and I hope the benefit of our students. It may perhaps, when you hear these figures, be necessary, really, to explain a little behind the background of the New Hambrian [phonetic] culture. We are lucky in studying a community which has had practically no immigration, no mass immigration, at any time in its existence. It has also not suffered from the other extreme disadvantage of depopulation, such as happened in some of the Hebridean Islands. Where as a result of living under economic circumstances in which most of the males had to leave the community. As population studies most circumstances usually reveal that this is the most eager, the most adventurous, and therefore the best material that tends to immigrate. So it has been an advantage in study of community for the culture going back more than a 1,000 years in that part of England where Christianity first took roots. Pardoned by a 1,000 years of tribal warfare in which there's never been a subsurdly [phonetic] peasant population. And over the last 400 years a slowly expanding industry in ship building and coal, the transmission of coal, the exporting of coal, which has absorbed nearly all the male labor. The males born into the population that have, of course, be the inevitable few immigrations which come from marriage. But it is against that background that I see my pediatrics in the community which I live in. And I have come to the conclusion that pediatrics now must continue. It is obvious to care, as obviously it will do, to carry the responsibility for the ready recognition of disease. Cure the disease. Research the disease. And must continue to carry the responsibility for the prevention of disease, which is insofar, particularly, as it can be prevented by a child health services. I think now it must concern itself with the culture of the community in which it lives, linking itself here perhaps to the educationalists. Perhaps occasionally, indeed, pointing out the educationalists so that they'll use a little better than the educationalists views might be. As to what is, indeed, the background of the welfare of children. So here I must confess, glad as I am to accept this opportunity to come to New York for a meeting like this and an occasion like this, that what I have to say concerns only the community in which I live in. And that the instrument which I have ready and briefly described has any application, it could have indeed to be modified to the community to which it was being applied. But unless we can, through succeeding generations, supply year by year, children who are sensitive, healthy, tough, courageous, to the community, not so afraid to whimsically examine what the educationalists are doing to them. Not to subservient to the enthusiastic technician who wants to safeguard their health. Not too prone to the blandishment of the popular press. Unless we can, in each generation, supplies human young of their kind. I am very grateful that at least the culture which I, myself, am interested in, may deteriorate. And so for that reason I say that pediatrics, I think, must go outside the ordinary formalized fields or some past pediatrics or formalized fields. Prevention, treatment, cure. And that I don't think even the attempts to define that work outside our social medicine insofar as my dear, revered, friend John Ryle tried to find was quite sufficient. The count of pediatrics, therefore, comes down. To all those processes and the study of all those processes to safeguard the welfare of children and particularly one which has been neglected to the present. That is the technique of MolCraft [assumed spelling].

>> Announcer: You've been listening to a talk on disease and its local setting given by Sir James Spence, M.D., Professor of Child Health at Newcastle upon Tyne, England. This has been the Linsley R.
