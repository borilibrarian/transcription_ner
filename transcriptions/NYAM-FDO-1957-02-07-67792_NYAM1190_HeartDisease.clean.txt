>> Will the meeting please come to order? The first order of business is the reading of the minutes of the last meeting by the Secretary, Dr. Wilkie.

[ Inaudible Remark ]

Unless there are any objections or amendments, we will dispense with formal parliamentary proceeding. And consider the meetings--the minutes approved and read. We are here this evening to listen to the 32nd Biggs Memorial Lecture. Dr. Hermann M. Biggs was a distinguished member of the medical profession in this city. He was what was then called Chief Medical Officer of the city which corresponds to our health commissioner. And he was also a Commissioner of Health at the state of New York. He contributed many innovations, public health practice, chief among which was his work in tuberculosis. Dr. Biggs died in 1923. And in 1924, his widow established a fund for the Hermann M. Biggs Memorial Lecture which he denoted to the New York Tuberculosis Association. And then in 1930, this fund was turned over to the Academy of Medicine, and since that time, the Biggs lectures have been given at a stated meeting of the academy, as tonight, under the auspices of the Committee on Public Health. The 15th lecture in the series was given here in 1940, by a gentleman named Paul Dudley White of Boston. His topic was heart disease, a world problem. And his performance on that occasion was so well received that he has been invited to give a return engagement this evening. Our guest is well-known in the field of cardiology in which he has been a leader and a pioneer. He has also established reputations in other fields. He is known as a mountain climber, a wood splitter, a bicycle rider and a whale hunter. He told us at dinner that he is leaving tonight on a whaling expedition to record the electrocardiogram of the great whale. Most recently, as most of you know, who read TIME Magazine, he appeared as a shoveler of snow. And he told me tonight that only a few Sundays ago, he appeared in the pulpit of a Greek Orthodox Church and delivered the sermon. So, you see, he is a many-sided individual. For me, it is a great pleasure to be able to present him to you for he has been a good friend, a dear friend over many years. Dr. White has chosen as the title of this lecture, The Relation of the Ways of Life to Heart Disease. Dr. White.

>> Dr. Levine [assumed spelling], Dr. Bailey [assumed spelling], Dr. Lincoln [assumed spelling], Dr. Craig [assumed spelling], ladies and gentlemen. I appreciate very much your invitation to come back to you after 17 years and to pay tribute again to Dr. Hermann Biggs who was a great pioneer in the field of public health. An ultimate title for my presentation tonight might be how to advise the youth of tomorrow for a protection from the heart diseases of today. In other words, the relationship perhaps the ways of life to heart disease. First, the question, 17 years ago on this platform, I tired to answer a question, asked a generation earlier in 1904 by Hermann Biggs. Today, a half generation later, I would like to pursue this question further. Let me quote first from Biggs himself. "The term sanitary science, public or state medicine and preventive medicine have frequently been used as almost synonymous. The latter term preventive medicine, however, like epidemiology, has sometimes been restricted in its applications to the prevention of the infectious diseases. In a broad sense, preventive medicine comprises both general prophylaxis and individual prophylaxis and applies to all forms of diseases as there's epidemiology not simply to the infectious diseases. Preventive medicine is an applied science which deals with the preservation of the health both of the individual and of the community." And still quoting, "No subject more vitally concerns the welfare of the community than that pertaining to its healthfulness, how the inhabitants live and how and what age they die." Sometimes we forget to record the age of our ancestry. "What is the extent and character of the morbidity appearing among them and what are its causes are questions of momentous importance. Their essential features in the problem or the solution will teach men how they may live longer, healthier and therefore happier lives." This is still a quotation. And you see he said the morbidity, the extent and character of the morbidity, that we haven't investigated even today of some diseases. We know something in the mortality, we need to make a house to house survey in large communities to do that and that's not yet been done. Biggs goes on to discuss the prevention of infections but ends with the following observations. "A very different problem arises in connection with the disease of the circulatory apparatus and the kidneys. My investigations have shown that in New York City, large increase has taken place. Due to these causes, during the last 20 years," that would bring it from 1884 to 1904, "The acute respiratory diseases, cancer and diseases of the circulatory apparatus and the kidneys are the only important causes of death which have shown an increase during this period." And there's other infections, other than the acute respiratory infections that apparently not have shown an increase. "The increase in cancer amounts to about 15 percent and the increase in the acute respiratory diseases to about 15 percent while the increase in the diseases of the circulatory apparatus and kidneys combined equals about 40 percent. "In making this statement, I have taken fully into consideration the possibility of greater accuracy in the death returns, that is the inclusion formally of these and the other causes of death. But after making all allowances, it seems to me without question that an increase equaling 40 percent has taken place." That is the figure that he started with. And this still a quotation. "A very important sanitary problem is here presented to the health authorities. What are the factors in the lives of the inhabitants of our large cities," and this is the big question. "What are the factors in the lives of the inhabitants of our large cities where I have found similar increases, less extensive, however, have taken place in London, Paris, and Berlin which have caused such a remarkable increase in the prevalence of these affections and how are these factors to be removed?" That then is the question. I concluded my own Biggs lecture of 1940 with the following remarks which immediately follow the quotation, "Just concluded." Thus, Biggs already clearly recognized this problem of heart diseases as one of preventive medicine and with worldwide significance 36 years ago. Can we answer his question? No, I believe not, except in minor details. But we have, I hope, a much clearer conception of the problems left to solve in response with the generation ago. I feel confident that much progress can be made and much more rapidly too during the generation that is to come tempered on your time to [inaudible] release. Now, as the end of the old quotation, now I start crazy. Now, half a generation later, how much further have we progressed towards the answer to the question asked by Biggs in 1904?

[ Pause ]

Biggs did not expect one answer so he put his question in a book, nor can we give one answer that settles the whole problem. However, we can give at least four answers of significance with the most important one [inaudible] still to be supplied, the most vital challenge to us in the immediate future. Meanwhile, since 1940, we have made great progress in medical science despite the Second World War. Perhaps we might excuse ourselves for not having advanced further in the half generation because of the war. But two of the greatest advances in the control and treatment of cardiovascular disease has actually stemmed from the experience in medical medicine--military medicine, a silver lining to the cloud of war which, however, is infinitely more harmful than helpful in the progress of mankind toward better health and happiness. The first of these two advances was the introduction of the antibiotics which have helped to eradicate infectious types of heart disease, in particular, aortic syphilis, bacterial and malignant endocarditis and to an appreciable degree, rheumatic heart disease itself. And the second advance was in cardiovascular surgery, a brilliant achievement and still in the early stages of its meteoric career. Advances have also been registered in diagnostic techniques, more scientific prognoses based on better family histories, and more adequate long followup studies, and most helpful of all, in cardiovascular rehabilitation. But the toughest challenges remain in the form of serious hypertension and atherosclerosis, not only of the coronary and cerebral arteries but of the aorta itself and then its major branches. I'd like to go back just a moment, the statement about prognosis and the importance of family history, I'm going over my own records. I got them out again repeatedly of cases of coronary thrombosis studied between 1920 and 1930, in particular, the 200 cases that were made of 25-year followup study. I was amazed to find that in my own records which I'd kept from the very beginning, I had done a very poor job in family history in the first few years. In 1921, '22, '23, and '24, my notes about family history were usually the lacking altogether of the statement good, favorable, bad, or average, something of that sort. Rarely did I record the actual age and deaths, causes of deaths of the parents. In 1926, for some reason or other, I began to see the light. And from that time on, I did record. Surprised I could the ages and causes of death of the parents and finally, also the grandparents when they could be obtained. But that took time, this is a slow evolution and yet this is one of the most important points about prognosis. Advances--go on from that point about advances, having this presented again in the question asked by Biggs 53 years ago, and having recognized the major new accomplishments in cardiology since 1940 and the problems that remain, I shall take up one by one the items that can supply partial answers. In the first place, a great change is taking place in the longevity of the inhabitants of the USA, almost totally dependent on the control of the infectious diseases. Since high blood pressure and atherosclerosis are much more common in older persons, it is natural to expect more heart disease now. I recently collected that pertinent data as to age and diagnosis at three groups of 100 consecutive medical patients each in the wards of the Massachusetts General Hospital, one hundred years ago in 1856, 50 years ago in 1906, which is two years after Biggs propounded this question and in 1956. One hundred years ago, the median age was 27 years and the average, 29.9. Fifty years ago, these ages were 34 and 33.7 respectively. And last year, they were 62 and 59.2 respectively. This is a tremendous difference, of course. In 1856, over a third of the patients had infections and only three were labeled cardiac. One with pericarditis, one with cardiac dropsy, and one with palpitation, two others had hemiplegia without this hypertension. There were no cases diagnosed as cancer, although cancer was known of course. One patient aged 45 died from old age and debility. This was the final diagnosis without any question mark in a patient who died in the hospital. In 1906, there were 29 with infections and 19 with cardiovascular disease, of which 13 were rheumatic, four had myocarditis in quotation marks, one had cerebral hemorrhage, and one had hemiplegia. There was one with cancer and 51 had miscellaneous other diseases or complaints. In 1956, there were 12 with infection, six with cancer, and 47 with cardiovascular disease, of which 24 were coronary, 12 had hypertension, and four rheumatic, there were 35 with miscellaneous diagnoses. As somewhat of a check on these clinical analyses, I have compared two sets of 100 consecutive autopsies, postmortem examinations, each done at the Massachusetts General Hospital, 100 consecutive postmortem examinations each down at the Massachusetts General Hospital in the 1890s and the 1950s, respectively. The first, especially recorded were those early ones and some of the last. In 1896 and 1897, there were only 11 of the 100 with cardiovascular disease. Three with mitral stenosis, three with pericarditis, two with cardiac hypertrophy and dilatation, probably hypertension, one with bacterial endocarditis and coronary embolism with myocardial infarction from the coronary embolism, a young patient, one with cardiac aneurism and left coronary artery atherosclerosis, that was the only one with myocardial infarction, definitely indicated, and one with trauma of the brain and heart. There were 10 cases of tuberculosis, 14 cases of pneumonia, seven of typhoid, four meningitis, and 17 of cancer, and one with sarcomatous metastasis in their heart. The ratio of male to female was about two of one, 64 to 36. Only 16 of the cases were called old, 33 were middle aged and 43 were young. The age is not noted, there were many age. And as the group, there were autopsies before the end of the century. In 1956, 100 consecutive autopsies included 51 over the age of 60 in contrast to only 16, 60 years earlier, 30 where middle aged, 13 were young and then the remaining six cases, the age is not specified in autopsy protocols. In males, the males numbered 65 and the females 35, almost exactly the same ratio as in 1896. There were over three times as many cases of heart disease, 35 compared to 11 and nearly twice as many with cancer, 31 to 17. Infectious diseases were relatively uncommon, only 12 cases in contrast to 35. Among the 51 cardiovascular cases, there were 22 of coronary nature, several also showing the effects of hypertension, eight with rheumatic valvular disease and nine with hypertension, most which had severe coronary atherosclerosis too. Two showed ruptured aortas, two of cor pulmonale and one of congenital defect, four had cerebral vascular lesions. Thus, here again, the age of the cases was apparently the determining factor, in large part, at least in these findings. Another--the second very important reason why heart disease is diagnosed more often today is that the good many cases were almost certainly mistaken years ago for something else, such as the debility of old age that ended in repeatedly. In the age, middle age, what we call middle age and old age was a frequent diagnosis a hundred years ago, many of them must have had died in a heart disease. All acute indigestion are not discovered at all or if discovered away from medical centers not recorded. It's important to remember that the first adequate description of coronary thrombosis was not published until 1912, nearly a decade after Biggs asked his question. And it was not even then widely recognized with still another decade. The pathological description of myocardial infarction and the coronary atherosclerosis had been, however, in the literature already for many years. In fact, the first account of the latter that I can find was entered by Theophile Bonet in the second edition of his Sepulchretum of 1700. But for some reason or other, despite the good descriptions of pathological cardiovascular conditions, relatively little attention was paid to any clinical pathological correlation by the practicing physicians. Richard Cabot with this famous CTC exercises was a pioneer in calling attention to this need. But again, that was in the main after Biggs's question. Even when coronary thrombosis began to be diagnosed clinically, the milder cases were not included as they would be now. In fact, among the 200 cases of coronary thrombosis with myocardial infarction personally seen and collected by myself in the decade between 1920 and 1930 to which I've just referred, there was not a single mild case. A hundred and sixty-three were severe and the other 37 were moderate. To this point, making the diagnosis apparently of mild--milder attacks and there are many mild attacks, many mild cases. Two other types of heart disease were also heavily under diagnosed, the hypotensive and the congenital. The blood pressure machine didn't come into common use until a decade or more after 1904. And the good many persons with some but not high degrees of cardiac enlargement from hypotension were missed. I remember when I was an intern at the hospital, we had perhaps two or three blood pressure machines in the hospital and we certainly didn't take routine measurements. It was only when such patients later went into heart failure that they were recognized and labeled Bright's disease or cardiorenal disease.

[ Pause ]

And we know now that hypotensive heart disease can exist for years before failure will come. The story about congenital cardiovascular disease is even more interesting still. In the 1920s, only one and one half percent of several thousand cardiac cases in New England were considered to have congenital defects. Twenty-five years later, the ratio had increased fivefold with a similar increase in total of numbers. Without a shadow of a doubt, this did not mirror the true situation. What had happened was that our diagnostic acumen had greatly improved because of our growing knowledge of the frequency of these defects and new diagnostic techniques, and also because children with congenital cardiovascular disease were finally brought by their family doctors and parents to consultants in clinics in the larger medical centers since at last surgical treatment to help them had been developed. A third reason for the increase in the diagnosis of heart disease of late years has been a change in the fashions of nomenclature and statistical analysis. What used to be called deaths from old age or debility even at 45 was often a cardiovascular death, perhaps some coronary insufficiency or pulmonary embolism, or aortic rupture, or a cerebral vascular accident. Now, all these are included under the category of cardiovascular disease and atherosclerotic disease of the kidneys which we have found to be one of the chief hazards of extreme old age and the series of patients we studied a few years ago has now rightly been shifted from primary kidney disease to where it belongs. And finally, in the course of this change in diagnostic customs, many deaths that are certain or rapid in their course. Our label is of coronary origin even without autopsy confirmation. With little doubt, most of these cases are correctly so designated but an unknown number are not, as noted by Dr. Lowe [assumed spelling] a few weeks ago at the meeting of the New York Heart Association here in New York City. Having presented these four reasons where at least some of the increase of patients diagnosed is having heart disease, we are left with the likelihood of any rate to passive probability at least possibility of an actual increase in young and middle aged men in the form of coronary thrombosis. And it is the challenge of this leading heart problem which demands our greatest efforts. No matter what evolution has been, it has descended upon us in epidemic proportions. Coronary thrombosis is not simply a problem of atherosclerotic disease of the coronary artery wall, it involves a blood clot too and the greater tendency for the blood to clot in some individuals than in others. And the arterial wall lesion is not such a simple matter either. More than a depreciation of cholesterol fat droplets is involved. Addison's finding, the frequency of intramural hemorrhages now being confirmed by Helton and Weinberg and [inaudible] of a possible or indeed problem with physical and mechanical that is primary hydrodynamic factor in initiating the whole process on a great need of further study. We are in the midst of a fascinating wide open future in pathological as well as in epidemiological relationships, the knowledge to the answer. Now, after these introductory observations, let us turn to an attempt to answer Hermann Biggs' question posed 53 years ago. Although experiments on animals of all kinds have afforded considerable information of value regarding the factors causing the various kinds of heart disease in men, their application to human disease has been in the main inadequate because the various kinds of heart trouble in men occurring infrequently if ever spontaneously in animals. Partial duplication can basically be induced in some species but that's a very poor substitute for the real thing in man. This is true, practically all varieties that had been studied whether in fowl, mice, rats, cats, dogs, and monkeys. Man himself has been studied experimentally as to expose with the various factors such as diet, exercise, stress and relaxation. But these studies are all worthwhile especially because one factor at a time can be altered and usually have been too brief or too limited in severity to yield the most important information. And so quite naturally, one turns to nature's experiments on men done on a grandest scale over generations or more of time, and often in an intensive degree. Valuable information of this sort is to be obtained by comparing one population with another living under the same condition, but best of all, by comparing various groups of the same population living under different conditions. Such epidemiological study, fascinating and vital as it is, must be acknowledged to be complicated, difficult, and expensive. When I discussed it in 1940, it was practically nonexistent but it looked well on paper. In presenting my hopes at that time in my first Biggs lecture, I wrote as follows. "Heart disease is a world problem, as much as is tuberculosis or dysentery or influenza, but it has not yet been investigated as such in contrast to many of the infectious diseases which have scourged the world, especially in the form of waves of devastating epidemics. It is natural that the rapidly fatal and highly contagious diseases should be studied first and brought soonest under control leaving for us of the present day the study and control of the less traumatic, more insidious and gradual but no less fatal maladies such as heart disease and cancer." International cooperation and worldwide study had become the matter of fact procedure in dealing with these serious infections. This is still being quoted. "The pioneer work at the Rockefeller Institute and other groups transcending national boundaries have broken the ground and shown the way. It should not then be too hard to follow their footsteps in the collection of invaluable information about the most important causes of heart disease and the incidence and the severity of their effects on the heart and all sorts of conditions and in every corner of the globe. Nature has for centuries been conducting gigantic experiments as to the effect of climate, type of work with diet and of local or worldwide disease on men, women, and children of different races that are spread out before our very eyes for us to record and to analyze. More readily yearling information than might ever be obtainable by our own experiments on man, although certain task could be added to enrich the findings. Under the most exacting conditions, animal experiments of this sort cannot be completely applied to man. Important clues and discoveries can result in experiments on laboratory animals, but if we rely only on them, we are letting go to waste an equally important source of information about heart disease. Statistics from surveys," this is still quoted, "are slowly accumulating in this country and in certain other countries but by different uncorrelated groups making them more difficult or even impossible for direct comparisons." Some 20 years ago, I attended a congress in Utrecht, Holland which occurred that time every three years of the--of geographic pathology in which [inaudible] and others took part. The subject was atherosclerosis but it was admitted at the very beginning that it was going to be an impossible job because the definition of atherosclerosis was quiet different in the different countries and they haven't decided on that first. We need to launch a well-organized study that can in a several-year program collect information that will really show how common hypotension and rheumatic valvular disease, encephalitic urethritis and coronary artery disease in relation to climate and mode of life. Several well and similarly trained groups under good clinical observers, stethoscopes, sphygmomanometers, electrocardiographs, x-ray apparatus and autopsy technique, and we might add now biochemists, physiologists and others, could in a few years accomplish more than the next century of desultory work and costs less than a single air raid over a city at war, this is written in 1940. Can't we divert the energy going to waste and destruction to these interesting and constructive efforts of humanity throughout the world? This is one of the reasons some of us went to Moscow in September to see if we could not have common ground to work on, be alive in this--together in the struggle against these common enemies. At least let us raise our voices in this direction just as soon as they can be heard. And in fact, there's no reason why in this hemisphere, we may not get started in this work within the near future if some group or individual will heed the call to finance the first expedition. Our participation in the Second World War began shortly after this appeal and prevented any full scale studies although circumstances did present greater value as in the case of the Scandinavian countries during and after the Nazi occupation. Finally, in the last half dozen years, concerted efforts sparked by Ancel Keys, Fred Stare and a few other pioneers have begun to scratch the surface. And at last, the growing realization of the importance of such epidemiological research has attracted the attention of those formally trained in the epidemiology of infectious diseases and in public health. At last, there's beginning to grow up a concerted effort to dig more deeply through the cooperation of physiologists, biochemists, clinical cardiologists, biostatisticians and public health workers trained in the field of the epidemiology of infectious diseases. This research would still require much more support both moral and material than it has had in the past has expanded to cover the globe and is enlisting scientific workers from many different countries. When we're in Japan, Japanese workers joined us, in Italy, Italians, Yugoslavs, in Finland, the Finns. In the remainder of my time, I'd like to present the problems that must be met and the effort to provide the final answers and the scanned information already available about two of the greatest public health hazards of all which happen to involve the heart and the blood vessels, namely hypertension and coronary atherosclerosis. They may be considered together but with certain distinctions since they are separate diseases. We're hearing really a great deal today in both medical and lay circles about the effects of the stress and strain, of diet and of exercise on the heart and blood vessels. But we have as yet very little sound information based on accurate and adequate study. The surface has nearly been scratched. But now, before I discuss what we know and especially what we must have learned about those environmental factors, let me present to you the basic factors which concern the person himself in the causation of heart disease. In my Biggs lecture of 1940, I took up one by one the different kinds of heart disease but I had little to say about the host. Although I used at that time in my discussion about the causes of heart disease, of companion title naming the ways of life in heart disease such as the--that'd be considered the title tonight comparable to the heading, Heart Disease, A World Problem, I did not take adequately into consideration the total epidemiological picture which of course includes host or the person himself equally with the agent.

[ Pause ]

Or the disease process. For some years now, I have appreciated the great importance of the host, ranking at least as high as if not indeed higher than that of the agent hence I shall now present what I like to call the basic factors which concern the host and which as yet in the present world status has been and still are largely beyond our control and which easily explains the fatalism of the past generations to which I shall return shortly. We know what most of these basic factors are which concern the host, but not necessarily all of them. Therefore, let us save space from X factor or two which may be discovered in the future. Race may be considered first. It is quite possible that there are racial differences and reactions to environmental factors like stress and strain and diet and exercise as there are known differences in response to exposing the various infectious diseases. When I was France with the AEF during the First World War, we had temporarily under our wing at our base hospital a number of French East African soldiers sick with the measles. Their mortality was high because of their almost a total lack of immunity to the disease. And so it may be in some instances with respect to hypertension and coronary heart disease. Most of the initial studies that had been carried out, however, suggest the racial responses to stress and strain and to diet are very similar, that in this relationship, the environmental factors may be predominant. However, much more research in the field itself both intensive and extensive would be needed to obtain the correct answer to this important question about race. Heredity comes next. Here we know from the personal experience of hundreds of thousands of us practicing physicians throughout the world that inheritance have susceptibilities to disease including important degrees of hypertension and coronary atherosclerosis and resistance thereto are of very great importance, perhaps more important than any other factor for the basic or environmental. But just how heredity acts and whether there is any way to alter such an effect remain for the future to determine. We have done almost nothing about these problems yet partly because it is physically, partly because we have not appreciated its importance, and partly because there are yet very few well-trained geneticists in the country or in the entire world today. Here is a challenge of the greatest magnitude. Some of the results of heredity have been correlated in partial degree at least with coronary heart disease in young adults. Although the most striking of all clues and studies that we have carried out concerning such young candidates was that of sex, there were other findings largely dependent on heredity data that had been prominent. One of these is body build in anthropological studies conducted a few years ago by a number of us in Boston. Dr. Gepper [assumed spelling] is here tonight. He had done most of the study for us. Mesomorphy, that is a broad muscular build figured permanently in our young coronary cases. There were no predominant ectomorphs in the entire series of 100 cases and there were only a few predominant endomorphs. There were quite a few endomorphic mesomorphs and still few are ectomorphic mesomorphs, but mesomorphy of high degree was frequent. Just how this is related directly [inaudible] is obscure. Another inherited feature in young cases is hypercholesteremia. Coronary heart disease has certainly been found more commonly in individuals and families with very high levels of serum cholesterol. It's also been stated on occasion that there are personality characteristics. But the great difficulty in such studies has been that they had been conducted after myocardial infarction or even before and not infrequently change has been observed resulting from the illness itself. It does seem true, however, that a predominant mesomorphic tends to have an energetic impatient personality of intending to drive himself and others too. But it's not necessary the drive which may produce stress and strain but other characteristics of individuals who happen to have this drive very lightly are responsible. The same may be true in such an individual with respect to an excessive use of tobacco or alcohol. Age, autopsy studies in successive decades after age 50 have shown increasing frequency of coronary atherosclerotic individuals and with often in increasing degree of severity. Although this does not always hold true clinically, however, it is in the 50s and 60s that the majority of the patients come to us with coronary heart disease and the same is true with hypertension. By the time of the 70s or 80s, a good many have succumbed which may in part account for the smaller numbers. Another reason why the problem tends to increase with the oldest ages is that as a person gets much older and retires, he is much less active and he's on to much less strain physically and emotionally. Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the relationship of age to coronary heart disease is the natural tendency for recovery, partly through the natural development of an adequate collateral coronary circulation in many persons, partly because of the good healing tendency in most instances of acute myocardial infarction, and partly because the individual himself of herself decreases his activity to save his reserve. This applies somewhat to hypertension too. Sex plays a major role as a basic factor, not only in coronary heart disease in younger individuals but also in the severity of hypertension in middle age. The male sex has a high degree of involvement in both cases. After they menopause, however, the female is no longer protected from serious coronary atherosclerosis and maybe seriously involved. It is now well-known that the female hormone protects the male in many species of animals including men. A note of a recent study by the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation put forth the serum lipids, lipoproteins and so on in units in non-castrated institutionalized male subjects stating that the serum lipid pattern which distinguishes the unit from the non-castrated may be importantly related to the unit's relative freedom from significant coronary atherosclerosis. Much research is still needed and the effort to discover some fraction of the female hormone or similar chemical agent that may be protected without harmonizing. There's a review of these basic factors concerning the host helps to explain the attitude of fatalism and pessimism, above progress in medicine that was held over the centuries doubtless from the time of the beginning of recorded history. During this long period, little was known or done about the agent, whether infectious or noninfectious. About 200 BC, the preacher in Ecclesiastes expressed the attitude which helped sway for well over 2,000 years and as a matter of fact, was still largely enforced at the beginning of my own medical career. I would like to quote a few phrases on the first and second chapters of Ecclesiastes which were given to me as a text at the time I talked to the vespers at the Greek Orthodox Cathedral a week ago on Sunday in Boston. I must say I've not read Ecclesiastes for a long time, but ever now is amazed at the remarkable literature and the pagan philosophy in this book. I was surprised that it ever became a book in the Bible. Chapter I, vanity of vanities, saith the preacher, vanity of vanities are always vanity. What profit hath the man of all his labor which he taketh under the sun? One generation passeth away and another generation coming, but the Earth bideth forever. The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be, and that which is done, is that which shall be done and there's no new thing under the sun. Is there anything whereof it may be said, see this is new? It hath been already of old time which was before us. I've seen all the works that are done under the sun, and behold all is vanity and vexation of spirit, that which is crooked cannot be made straight, and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. For in much wisdom is much grief, and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. And one verse from Chapter II, and I looked at all of the works that may hands had wrought and on the labor that had labored to do, and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no profit under the sun. Only during the last generation are a little more have we been able to turn from such a spirit and life of fatalism and pessimism to the optimism that abounds in medicine today. These changes come largely through a change in environment. Man has made crooked things straight, has cured defects surgically within the heart and the blood vessels. Man has used potent medicines effectively. And now we believe that it may through other alterations of the environment succeed in protecting the young candidates of the future against these serious diseases of today, especially so far as the heart blood vessels are concerned namely hypertension and coronary heart disease. It is the environmental factors to which in particular Hermann Biggs and I referred in 1904 and 1940 respectively. And it is concerning me is that we may look hopefully to the results of future research. What are these factors? We can name some but space should be reserved for others not yet identified or specified which we may call line Z. Stress and strain, the first that is so much discussed nowadays in which undoubtedly plays a role at least in the secondary precipitating or aggravating capacity is stress and strain. By this, we mean primarily emotional stress. Physical and mental strain are sometimes included but should be considered separately primarily as work or exercise. Is has long been recognized that the emotions by influencing the psyche have a great deal to do with health, in fact, until the last generation or two, the only medicine that could really be practiced except for a very few specific remedies was psychosomatic medicine. This still is an important part of the work or the physician but it has not been adequately studied. If the emotions can alter the physical, chemical and physiological aspects of the body is quite certain, but the mechanism is still obscure and could be well and profitably investigated. However, to blame stress and strain for such disease as coronary heart disease or even hypertension is still premature. It has been the experience of people through the ages and in many of us today that stress and strain are universal and probably have existed in high degree all through history. This generation has no monopoly on stress and strain. Every generation has complained of its emotional difficulties and it isn't just a matter of the speed of modern life. There was probably more stress felt by some person in the middle ages running to escape some [inaudible] than we ourselves may encounter sitting comfortably in an airplane as I did recently traveling 400 miles an hour.

There are, however, five considerations concerning stress and strain that needs special comment. One is without doubt in the presence of the important degrees of high blood pressure or coronary atherosclerosis within pending insufficiency, emotional stress and strain can aggravate the condition, precipitating trouble and even causing sudden death when the reserve is very low. The second consideration is that what is stress or strain for one individual may not be for another. Here, the host of course must be considered as well as the agent. A third consideration is that a certain amount of stress and strain may actually be helpful in the maintenance of a state of vigorous health. The fourth consideration is that it is quite possible that repeated stress and strain over long intervals of time may in certain individual establish higher levels of blood pressure and indeed even changes in the blood vessels to which I shall refer next. Finally, an interesting new clinical viewpoint about the beginning of atherosclerosis to which I've referred is that hydrodynamic strain which may be increased by emotional stress with increasing blood flow and blood pressure may act to initiate and to aggravate the earliest lesions of the intima of blood vessels such as the coronary and cerebral arteries and aorta and its main branches. I would like to refer to a measure that I have used in the treatment of patients who are subjected to stress and stain all who worry very much about themselves or others. This is in the form of a prescription which I write for them. Instead of a medicine not infrequently, I prescribe the reading of Sir William Osler's, "Aequanimitas". The delightful essay which has gave us the valedictory address at the University of Pennsylvania in 1889. I can highly recommend it to all to read even though it was presented primarily to the medical students and the medical faculty. This is a good Rx. Research on the effect of stress and strain on the heart and circulations is badly needed and must be carried out despite its complexity and difficulty. One of the committees of the American Heart Association which has been asked to submit recommendations concerning the effect of strain and trauma on the heart is labeling with this problem at present and has been doing so for several years. Eventually, we hope that there may be some useful recommendations resulting from the researches going on. Exercise. Our medical ancestors were obliged to exercise much more than is the custom of most inhabitants of the more so-called--of the so-called more civilized countries of today. Prosperity has brought with it great neglect of this health measure, and in one generation, there's been a very striking decrease in the use of our muscles. Although we have no adequate proof yet that such neglect is very harmful and although it is possible to help us to live long and exercise little, there's a difference between the state of positive health favored by exercise and that of a sound physical condition even in the absence of disease. Exercise has physiological benefits and improves the circulation, in fact it acts as an accessory pumping mechanism to help the heart. Good muscle tone in the extremities compresses the veins which with well acting valves help to return blood to the heart. Pre-motion of the diaphragm favored by vigorous exercise helps not only to bring air into the lungs but through its negative pressures that pump helps to bring blood up from the lower part of the body back to the heart. In addition, exercise without any doubt has a favorable effect in most individuals as at least a partial antidote to nervous stress and strain. It so acts with me and many of my friends and patients. The person himself obtains great benefit through the relaxation of nervous tension which come through just exercise. Doubtless, the more highly muscled individuals need more exercise and when we think of the common practice of our ancestors, only a generation or two ago are walking along distances routinely, of helping to clear the forest in a vigorous hunting and fishing, we must admit that our present way of life is very different. I would like to quote here a stanza written in part as a letter--part of a letter by John Dryden in 1680, extolling the advantages of the country life and of exercise to cause a rather extreme viewpoint, but I believe that there is more truth than poetry in it. Some of you have heard me read this before. By case, by physical exercise, our long life fathers earned their food, toil strong the nerves, improve the nerves, and purified the blood that we their sons, a pampered race of men dwindled down to three-score years and 10. Better to hunt in fields for health onboard than see the doctor for nauseous [inaudible]. The wise procure an exercise depend God never made this work for men to men. Finally, with respect to exercise, there is the possibility that it may even have a favorable effect in retarding the onset of coronary heart disease. Some suggestions of this come from experimentation in animals and in men too. But much more research is needed before we can speak with any certainty one way or the other. I myself have found that exercise in moderation is one of the best ways to treat many of my convalescent cardiac patients and the establishment of a good program or regular exercise I find is often more important than many medicines. Diet. The particular way of life or environmental factor that has attracted the most attention in the epidemiological studies had been going on in the last few years has been that of diet. Unfortunately, premature advice based on inadequate evidence has become the fashion, but we must await further detailed studies during the next few years before we can be sure the best advice to give either to healthy persons, to prevent trouble out of those who have high blood pressure or coronary heart disease already. As a result, we do know that hypertension tends to be aggravated by high intake of sodium and hence diets low in sodium represented ordinarily by common salt had been found useful. It is really necessary, however, to decrease the amount of sodium to such a low level as that in the famous rice diet. There is no doubt that remarkable gains have not infrequently been secured by such rigidity of diet, but on the other hand, it has not been necessary in many cases to go to such an extreme. So far as the coronary circulation is concerned, in the absence of congenital hypertension, a low sodium intake does not seem indicated. Further consideration of salt in the diet brings up the possibility of a causative relationship between an unusually high salt intake such as that which is found in some parts of Japan and hypertension which is quite common there even when coronary heart disease is uncommon. And further studies of this interesting possibility are advisable. The most interesting dietary problem of all, however, concerns the fat intake. For a long time, at least as far back as 25 years ago, a diet rich in fat has been incriminated as a probable cause of coronary heart disease. I myself can well remember the days when Timothy Leary and Elliot Joslin of Boston, this was at least 25 years ago, independently gave some of us advice not to eat two eggs for breakfast because of the high cholesterol content. And this advice has since been--then been strengthened by a much wider circle of investigators and their followers. I compromised I have ever since eating one egg for breakfast. However, the questions and answers are more complicated than that. In the course of the last decade, viewpoints have changed a good deal. And because of this, there are a good many skeptics. I suppose that the truth rests somewhere between the viewpoints of individuals who are vigorous in their advice to be aware of all fats and those of others who'd go to the opposite extreme in their advice to pay little or no attention to the fat content of diet or even to advocate high contents of fat as does the explorer, Stephenson. Studies initiated by Ancel Keys and some of which I myself have participated have shown in different parts of the world, particularly in Italy, South Africa, Japan, Hawaii, Sweden, Finland and the USA that populations exposed to a rich fat diet appear to be afflicted by much more coronary heart disease than populations not so exposed no matter what other factors they may be. However, this is all in the form of preliminary studies and much more research of populations themselves is needed for fuller appraisal. First of all, starkly, I suppose obesity in general was considered an important error which might lead to coronary heart disease no matter what food supply the excess calories in as much as the body can manufacture its own fat out of carbohydrate and protein. Then the pendulum began to swing somewhat away from that point of view. An incrimination began of all the factors responsible for the increased calories, that is both animal and vegetable fats and that this might happen even without obesity. It began at this time also to be widely recognized that it was not necessarily increased work demanded by carrying around extra weight, but the fact that a few ounces of fat in the wrong place, for example, in the coronary artery walls might do more harm than many pounds of fats simply under the skin. The next change came when there was a sharp distinction between animal fats and vegetable fats, the former being considered hazardous and the latter safe no matter what kind of animal or vegetable fat. The next change in this would come every few months. Next change has been much more recent with an indication that hydrogenated, saturated or processed fats whether animal or vegetable were likely to be the villains in the piece rather than the unsaturated, non-hydrogenated or unprocessed fats. Finally, the latest information of all suggest that some protection is afforded by certain fats of the same chemical nature represented particularly by corn oil and fish oils and somewhat less by cottonseed oil and by seal blubber in contrast to coconut oil and other vegetable oil, which seems to be in the same class with some of the animal fats. In conversation a few days ago with Ancel Keys, however, in Minneapolis indicated that the protection afforded by corn oil is very slight when it is simply added to the ordinary diet which has the additional disadvantage of increasing their calories. If other fats are replaced by corn oil or fats with similar chemical constitution, it does seem to be a favorable effect on the serum cholesterol content which may or may not be reflected in protection of the coronary wall from atherosclerosis. Thus, it is quite obvious that we are in the midst of the evolution of much important research and that no hard and fast statement can be made about diet. And I haven't put this in, but it's commonly appreciated and I think it may be true that one man's meters and other man's poison here would deal with the host as well as the agent. Or we can advice at present as to avoid both obesity and an over rich fat diet probably if that content not exceeding 30 percent of the total calories is quite reasonable, certainly for some people but not necessarily for all. This too may be partly dependent on the amount of regular and vigorous exercise. Too little is known accurately about the effect of tobacco and alcohol in the production of the atherosclerotic process but there seems to be little or no likelihood that these are involved in the underlying process. However, given severe atherosclerotic changes with coronary insufficiency, an important degree of--or an important degree of hypertension, tobacco and even on occasion the overuse of alcohol can be harmful because of the aggravation of the disease process.

In summary then, it may be concluded from the observations that I have made in this lecture that we are not yet on solid ground with respect to advice that we may give to the youth of tomorrow to avoid certain of the heart diseases of today, especially hypertension and severe coronary atherosclerosis. We may need another decade or two before we can speak with assurance. Perhaps the best advice is to carry out common sense measures that lead to a state of [inaudible] good health, and most important of all, to support in full an important research on these causative factors that is in progress today and which will be developed more fully in the future. And in closing, I would like to quote as I have in the past on occasion the advice or the comments in press of a former public health worker who was very prominent 100 years ago, Oliver Wendell Holmes himself in 1860 at a meeting with the National Sanitary Association wrote for that annual meeting. "What makes the healing art divine? The bitter drug we buy and sell, the brands that scorch, the blades that shine, the scars we leave, the cures we tell. Are these thy glories, holiest art, the trophies that adorn thee best, or but thy triumph's meanest part where mortal weakness stands confessed? We take the arms that heaven supplies for life's long battle with disease, taught by our various need to prize our frailest weapons, even these. But ah, when science drops her shield, its peaceful shelter proved in vain and bares her snow-white arm to wield the sad, stern ministry of pain. When shuddering o'er the fount of life, she folds her heaven-anointed wing to lift unmoved the glittering knife that searches all its crimson spring. When faithful to her ancient lore, she thrusts aside her fragrant balm for blistering juice or cankering ore and tames them till they cure or calm. When in her gracious hand are seen the dregs and scum of earth and seas, her kindness counting all things clean that lend the sighing sufferer ease. Though on the field that death has won, she saves some stragglers in retreat. These single acts of mercy done are but confessions of defeat. What though our tempered poisons save some wrecks of life from aches and ails, those grand specifics nature gave were never poised by weights or scales. God lent his creatures light and air and waters open to the skies, man locks him in a stifling lair and wonders why his brother dies. In vain our pitying tears are shed, in vain we rear the sheltering pile. Where art weeds out from bed to bed, the plagues we planted by the mile." This was the time of child bed fever. He was once [inaudible] in puerperal sepsis, as you may remember 100 or more years ago. Now, at that time, these diseases were spread through the hospitals. Now, in some way or other, we're spreading another plague or another plague is among us in the form of coronary thrombosis. You can't be too boastful yet. "Be that the glory of the past with these our sacred toils begin. So flies in tatters from its mast the yellow flag of sloth and sin. And lo, the starry folks reveal the blazoned truth we hold so dear, to guard is better than to heal, the shield is nobler than the spear." Thank you very much.

>> Dr. White has given us a very thought-provoking lecture. He has pointed out incisively gaps in our knowledge. He's indicated paths which may be followed in order that we may find out more concerning these gaps. And I think to be stressed is his attitude toward not applying prematurely to practice those bits of knowledge which are available at present such as restrictions in diet before all the facts are known and we are justified in changing radically the habits of our patients. I'm tempted to give a quotation too which I'm very fond. It's a quotation from Alexander Pope. It's a simple one. "Be not the first by whom the new are tried nor yet the last to throw the old aside." Now, Dr. Acille [assumed spelling] Lincoln who is the chairman of the subcommittee on the Biggs lecture of the Public Health Committee will express our thanks to Dr. White.

>> May I just interrupt a moment? Say, that I suppose the most important lesson I may have is that we must consider the host in these studies just as much as the agent. In other words, we can't expect to make rules to hold--to fit every single person. We must decide who are the candidates for hypertension and coronary disease and then protect them and not have sweeping rules for all of us. Therefore, as much study must be made at the host as of the agent and that still remains to be done.
