This establishment is self-supporting administratively and financially. It is not receiving any [inaudible] from the development and its function is established in the [inaudible] from the research work for the production. The researchers are inspiring and improving the production. This production continually explains its researches. No commercial consideration is taking place in regards of the production. Its principle object being to protect the public health. The Pasteur Institute restrain itself [inaudible] and to sell products of which efficacy and [inaudible] even if those are products are assured by their mature and the credit which is given to them by the public opinion two-prong [phonetic] to take an interest in the great [inaudible] problems even if these products were to be sold on a great scale.
