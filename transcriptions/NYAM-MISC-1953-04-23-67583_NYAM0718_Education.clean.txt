>> Professor Ralph Linton: As I sat in on the conference this afternoon, I had an increasing uneasy feeling that everything that couldn't be said on the subject was being said, that I was going to be left this evening with nothing to talk about. I still have something of that feeling. However, there are a few points that I want to make. I hope you'll pardon me if I do not adhere strictly and absolutely to the title that's been given me tonight, and add a little confusion to the complexity, as I heard mentioned so often, by pointing out that there are certain other aspects of anthropology which sooner or later are going to become a real consideration of health education, and of workers in this field. We are beginning to realize -- we must remember first of all that anthropology deals not only with culture but also with man as an animal, shall we say, with human physiology, with susceptibility to disease, dietary requirements, things of that sort. And we are beginning to recognize now that the theories so vigorously promulgated a few years ago to the effect that racial differences were merely optical illusions really, are now somewhat passe. We know that there are very definite differences in the disease resistances and susceptibilities of different human groups. Now, this has come out, for instance, in the late war, where the European is relatively immune but is relatively tolerant of what we call "benign person malaria," that's the reason we call it "benign," while it will knock the African for a loop in colloquial parlors [phonetic]. Now, while on the other hand, the malignant -- what we call "the malignant" type of malaria they African is highly tolerant of, but it's exceedingly hard on the white man. There are whole series of disease tolerances and susceptibilities which are going to have to be taken into account in health training, in health education. For instance, this far north the Negro is much more susceptible to tuberculosis than the white man. He requires a different -- you would have to lay more stress on those aspects of health education, which have to do with this. Conversely, you don't have to worry hopefully about American Indians and typhoid fever because the pure blood American Indian is practically immune to this disease, so on down the line. Another very important aspect that comes in here is that if you are going to move peoples around, you must remember that if you take a group who are tolerant of a particular disease into a region where there is a vector, and a human group which has not been previously exposed to this disease, you are going to practically wipe them out. We know, for instance, that there are great areas in the -- in tropical America which are almost completely depopulated by malignant malaria introduced by the Negro slaves, who were brought over by the Spaniards. Well, this is one aspect of it. Another aspect is that when you come to train to teach individuals about diet, we must remember that there are different human groups who actually have different dietary requirements, whatever the reasons may be. I know one of my friends who has been working in Puerto Rico told me that by all our present dietary tables there -- about 20% of the Puerto Ricans should be dead. They're not. [Laughter] They not only are able to work, and particularly to breathe under these circumstances. Evidently there are -- I don't know whether you can call these racial differences, but different human groups who have for a long time been on particular diets have developed different dietary requirements. I suspect myself that these are connected with differences in intestinal [phonetic] fauna, but in spite of intestinal flora and fauna, but in spite of my suggestion as to that many people -- I haven't gotten anybody so far who has been willing to work on this. I have a happy picture of the day when by taking one capsule you can knock the vitamin trait out of existence, if I had set up all the necessary bacterial cultures at once in your own interior. Well, this is one area of -- where anthropology can be very much of use by helping to save the health educator from wasting his time and energy in trying to educate for things that are not of particular importance to particular human growth. Now, turning to the field of cultural anthropology, I want to say first of all, don't be frightened by the terminology. Any subject is terrifically complicated if you go into it far enough. But it can be said of the social sciences in general that anyone who works in this area is under great temptation to lapse into all sorts of technical terms, because if you say most of the things that social scientists recognize and have found out in plain English, it immediately appears to everybody that they have known them all along. The science -- this is an area which is highly complicated, yes. And you can make it much more complicated by the introduction of suitable terminology, which also serves as a smokescreen in those cases where you're not perfectly sure what you're talking about yourself. Actually, culture, as the anthropologist uses the term, is merely the way of life of a particular people. It's a sort of thing that everybody -- anybody who is not, shall we say, completely opaque, completely unable to see what's going on around him, like certain missionaries and my acquaintance have been, I may say, anybody who lacks this opacity very soon gets on with the culture. After all, cultures are not so different when you come down to it. Anthropologists began with a collection of cultural differences as Teriosa [phonetic], the odd habits of this, that, or the other society will be enshrined in a volume, let us say in the Golden Ball [phonetic], something of that sort, in very much the way that the first archeologists collected arrowheads to be put in a cabinet in the corner, and exhibited to admiring visitors. We know -- after all we know that now that human beings are surprisingly alike, living as members of organized societies, they're up against a limited range of possibilities and organization and so on. Anyone can very soon learn to find his way around another society. Now, this is particularly true and the sort of thing that you people are up against. It's nice to hear of the curious behavior of Australian aborigines, et cetera, but the people you're going to be working with are either Europeans, a few relatively small number of displaced Orientals, occasional American Indians in the process of acculturation, and the American Negro, who of course is more different than it looks on the surface when you come down to really -- if you really get to know Negro cultures. But still all these cultures fall in fairly narrow limits. And it's not too hard to find your way around. The -- you simply use common sense. [Inaudible] this afternoon that that phrase was never used once. I know that it's not fashionable at the present time, but I've lived myself in a number of rather divergent societies, and in some of them where it was of considerable practical importance to get along with the people. For instance, I lived with one -- lived for 2 years with one group where when I went to these particular islands I was assured I wouldn't have any trouble because they hadn't eaten a white man for 10 years. [Laughter] Under these circumstances there was a definite incentive to [laughter] get on good terms with the people. And it wasn't particularly difficult. Any person who was going in for health education should proceed, first of all, shall we say to follow the dictates of good taste and good manners to get to know these people, to approach them slowly, particularly never try to hang anything on them, because I could assure you if you are working with an alien group that you won't get away with anything. They know everything that you do. You can be sure that you're under observation every minute, under discussion you're a curious outsider, they want to know what you're there for, and so on. And it's similarly with [inaudible] I'm afraid for urban groups, such as this, but I have always thought that in getting acquainted with an alien group and then trying to put over a program, the process was very much like that trying to put a halter on a mule. You have to show him the halter, let him smell it, work up on him cautiously from the side, and finally slip it on, after he's sort of gotten used to the idea and gotten used to your being around. There are certain things that you have to find out immediately when you are working with -- when you want to put over any sort of a program, or when you want to get along with the group. You have to find out, first of all, the social structure. In other words, what the group is that you are dealing with. [Coughs] There are very few societies that are really homogenous. You find that the -- we were talking this afternoon about various groups, so on, but you find that any society has the limits within which its members think. I have just received an exceedingly interesting report from a former student of mine, a Dr. Manny Fowler [phonetic], who's now doing work for Tuskegee Institute. They have -- this is very much in line with what you're talking about now because they're trying to improve rural health here, [inaudible] at these rural Negro communities. They were totally unconscious of the existence of the campus. Here were doctors, here was a hospital so on available for Negros and quite close in where they could have access to it, but nobody in the community that he was working with ever thought of going to it. It is simply outside their social horizon. You have to find what the limits of the groups -- the limits within -- the terms in which they think are. You have to find out within this group where power lies; because I can assure you, there are no such things as equalitarian societies. There is always a prestige hierarchy, and again as common sense will tell you, you can always work down from the top much easier than you can work up from the bottom. The thing to do is impact the key individuals and to sell them on the program that you want to put over. Now, this has to be done various ways. You can make it a matter of prestige. Other people are doing this. And other people are saying, "My, they are doing this, and I should fall in line." Or you can make it a matter of advantage. Interestingly enough, as we know from innovators, the person who is likely to be most useful to you is the individual of high prestige but somewhat doubtful status. Remember that the individual who is of high prestige and of the [inaudible] status doesn't want to start anything new. They're sitting pretty. [Laughter] It is the individual who is of high enough prestige [inaudible] carry weight, but is not completely satisfied with the status quo, who's going to go along with you. The first people -- and I may add that if you are trying to introduce the program, the first people to detect are always the people who are somewhat maladjusted. In other words, they're not satisfied with the status quo and constantly are ready to work along with you in the sense of recruiting the situation. You have to be exceedingly practical in terms of what they can actually -- what people can actually do with the setup that they have. Again, Dr. Fowler sent me a number of verbatim comments, and the one that perhaps I enjoyed most was that of an old colored lady, "Sure takes a lot of water to be sanitary." [Laughter] This is in a situation where they had to get all their water out of wells and haul it up by hand. Well, there is a certain point here where diminishing returns set in if they expect you to -- if you expect them to haul up too much water. They decided it just isn't worthwhile. And in the same way you can give the most elaborate briefing on proper diet, et cetera, to a group who can't afford it. I remember with amusement some years ago -- I'm trying not to get outside the modern American frame of reference, but some years ago among the Navajo, where a teacher was giving a course in domestic science, and was training the Navajo girls in the school how to make tasty little salads [phonetic] [inaudible] pears, et cetera.

[ Silence ]

Well, [laughter] the only sort of pears that grow on the reservation, you may remember, are prickly pears. Well, [coughs] the only thing that is required here really is just the use of common sense. The various methods of stating culture patterns, social structure, and so on are useful tools, but they must be regarded as tools. What you have to get first is the concrete information on how the people live and on what they want and what they consider as important. Again, as this came out very clearly in our discussion this afternoon, value is different. Practically everybody wants to be healthy. That's obvious. But the question is how badly they want to be healthy, and how much trouble they want to take on it, what they think it's worth. It is exactly like cleanliness. There are some people who are -- there are some cultures who lay tremendous stress on cleanliness. I remember a French -- and I remember captain of a French liner that I traveled on once saying that the great difficulty with Americans was that they could not realize that a man might be a great sage and a philosopher, and at the same time dirty. [Laughter] Well, there are a good many societies in which the old saying, which I remember from my -- I may say Quaker childhood, but after all everybody has to eat their peck of dirt, is expanded to, shall we say, a bush hall, where it's taken for granted that a certain amount of dirt does nobody any harm. And why should you labor so elaborately to clean things up? Also, you will have difficulty, of course, in explaining to these people why they should be clean, why they should do certain things. However, again, this can usually be put over. One thing that you must remember, particularly in dealing with members of other groups, is that these people are not stupid, they are not childlike, or anything else. They've got a different culture, but they're just as bright as you are. And you'll find some of them that are brighter, I may say. And the -- you just -- you have to appeal to them. In the appeal to them logically, but in terms of their logic and their premises. I remember the gentleman who worked for years with the Rockefeller people trying to abolish hookworm. He said he had a grant, and it was very easy in Fiji because they believe that snakes cause sickness anyway, and all he had to do was to throw an enlarged fly. The hookworm was on the screen, and they all fell for it right away. But if you're in some other society where they believe that disease is due to malevolent magic, shall we say, that doesn't help much. There are different kinds of -- different approaches required for this -- required to deal with this, their thinking. You also will find in any society, that's any group that you have to deal with, that they already have their therapeutic methods. And don't underrate these in advance. There's very often -- after all our own science, remember, changes from time to time. Since I've had my own coronary I have seen the order not to eat any butter or any eggs, anything that contains cholesterol as a tenant of science, and now it has become a superstition, as we know more about it. Don't say offhand that something is entirely foolish, because behind this -- behind much of the magical procedure, there lies experience. This stuff has worked, whatever the reason is. And almost any method of treatment, which a society has used regularly has got something to it. Now, the effects may be purely psychosomatic. You recognize that. But nevertheless don't try immediately to set in train whole new techniques, and particularly don't tell the people you have to deal with that these elders, these healers, and so on whom they respect, are just a bunch of fools, because they can always point to cures that these people have made. The psychosomatic effects, if nothing else, are exceedingly good. After all our own setup of doctors' offices, hospitals, et cetera have certain magical aspects as we must recognize. We get some very amusing examples of this sort of thing when you operate with -- when you work with a widely divergent culture. Again, I'm forced out of our immediate setting here. The -- where you have, you know, the medicine man he -- medicine -- you -- preventative medicine man combines almost always real material medical -- often it's been arrived at in the same way that our own material medical was, at the cost of many individuals who got the wrong dosage and you finally worked out which dosage work, you see. But this is always combined with a certain amount of mumbo jumbo which gives us the proper setting. I remember that when I was operating as a medicine man myself in Madagascar, that if you simply gave a person pills, you didn't expect results. He didn't expect results. So he was pretty sure not to get them. For instance, when I gave quinine, which was a very effective [inaudible] against fever, I never gave it in a pill, I had the gentleman stir it up in warm water and drink it slowly. And this left him conscious for hours that he had the strong medicine. [Laughter] You see. And worked very effectively. And another thing, they didn't know how to treat wounds. And of course didn't know anything about antiseptics. Well, if you tried to explain to them that -- about bacteria, et cetera, you soon would have put your practitioner to sleep or you would have lost interest completely. But if you explain, "Did you ever think of boiling your implements?" "No." But boiling is good magic. Of course. It was just something they realized that this was something that they had overlooked. It was quite impressive. You see, you've got the -- you get your brew boiling and then you drop the things in, and then for -- make sure they've got the right time, course no watches. I told them that they should [inaudible] this invocation, which was actually the wearing of the green. [Laughter] You got the water boiling, drop it in the tools, then 5 verses of the wearing of the green while it boiled, and then very carefully pick it out. But all this is perfectly good magic. You don't have to say anything about bacteria. And it worked. And of course they found that they had much better results, and so were able to -- were willing to take this on. Well, the only point that I want to make is don't be -- use the cultural concepts, social structural concepts and so on simply as handy tools. But don't look upon them as something esoteric, something difficult, terribly difficult to understand. The most important thing in any sort of health education is the person-to-person contact. Get yourself trusted by the group that you're trying to educate so that they -- if they -- even if they don't understand quite what you're trying to do, they'll take your word for it. If you try to work from a distance with the average uneducated group, you just don't get anywhere. But above all, use common sense. Thank you.

>> I'm sure you have all been fascinated as I have been in listening to [inaudible]. And it boils down, as he says, to common sense. May I [inaudible] and illustrate what you said [inaudible] story? [Laughter] And let's do so. It's the story of an old [inaudible] who took a vacation. He hadn't had one for years and years and years. And he got a local [inaudible] to come and take his practice. This was a young man just out of medical school, and he went to the doctor's house and into his consulting room and dispensary because he dispensed his own medicine. And he found to his horror on the shelves of the dispensary a number of bottles in which his patients had brought various specimens to be examined. But the specimens had never been examined at all, and the bottles just stood there with the contents undergoing various chemical changes. [Laughter] And he came to concluding that when the doctor [inaudible] just took one of these bottles off the shelf, poured out bottles in it, and poured in the medicine. [Laughter] And he thought he had to tell him. So he -- first thing he did was to take all those bottles with their varied contents and totally wash them out, and he boiled them and put them back in the shelves, and he dispensed his medicines in those bottles. Well, in due course the doctor came back. And one of his old patients came back too and he says, "Oh, Doctor, I'm awful glad to see you back." "You came back, young fellow. He gave me the medicines, you know, but man they had me there [inaudible]." [Laughter] So there you are. I'm sure we are all terribly indebted to Professor Linton for bringing us down to earth and telling us just the things that we ought all to be thinking of, and I'm sure it's going to help us in our work no matter what light it's in to just come down to earth and use our common sense. [Laughter] Thank you, sir.
