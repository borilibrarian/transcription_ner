>> John Murray Steele: The relationship of gerontology to public health and where and to what extent public health is concerned with elderly persons is a subject of growing importance. I do not want to burden you with a lot of statistics, but in order to lay briefly before you some of the spade work that has been carried out to define the magnitude of the problem, I want to quote a few figures from a very excellent report of the New York State Join Legislative Committee on problems of aging under the egis of Senator Thomas C. Desmond, who has spot plugged this movement from the beginning and introduced appropriate legislature. New York State's entire population increased ten percent from 1940 to 1950, but the number of persons over 65 years of age has increased 39 percent. This is a surprising statement. People over 65 years of age are increasing at four times the rate of the general population. In 1948, an analysis of roughly eight million people over the age of 65 showed that 6.4 million, or eighty percent, had incomes of less than $2,000.; 4.8 million, or sixty percent, less than $1,000; and 2.5 million, or thirty percent, less than $500 a year. I think this gives some idea of the magnitude of the problem with which we must deal. The latest estimate of the number of persons over 65 years of age in the United States today is something more than 13 million. If, then, the proportions of the 1948 survey still hold, we can estimate that there are roughly four million indigent aged to be cared for completely and nearly eight million who will require some assistance. Before we can analyze the problem of the welfare of the aged for the public health and for the community, it becomes necessary to classify our elders. This sounds impertinent, but since it will not be long before I join their ranks, I think I shall risk it. First, there are well, healthy old people. Now these we must divide into two groups. A small proportion of them have homes to live in and adequate independent incomes. They may have a good pension, or they may be well supported by their children or relatives or independently wealthy. These individuals present no community problem, but may well require the advice of physicians, social workers, or perhaps of a special job counselor service to help them find ways to spend their time in a profitable and enjoyable manner. Then there's a larger group of well old people without homes or without financial support. It is this group which presents the large social and economic problem that is right in the lap of the community. This is the problem of public health. These individuals should not be living in public hospitals, as many are forced to do, or in crowded, inadequate homes for the aged. What is the community, that is to say, you and I, going to do to help them? The answer, obviously, cannot be supplied at once, but it is encouraging that national and state organizations have been busy defining the magnitude of the problem and have made suggestions and taken certain actions for partial solutions. Secondly, there are sick old people. Now these present medical, mental, psychological problems as well as a social and economic ones, but please note that a young person, incapacitated by chronic disease, may present nearly the same problem except that he's more apt to have financial support and a home to go to. Let us take up the care of this sick group first. I have on numerous occasions put the medical groups with whom I have been asked to discuss the subject of geriatrics the following question. If I were to settle down among you to practice the specialty of geriatrics, could I count on you to turn your patients over to me when they reach their 65th birthday? Of course, all I ever get for an answer is a cross between a horse laugh and a rueful smile, and quite correctly so. No one would do it, and I think they're wise. I doubt very much, too, that the patient would like the arrangement either, and the reason for this is not far to see. The fundamental treatment for a given disease is essentially the same for all ages, and after all, one has no means of treating aging per se except perhaps for the doubtful practice of using estrogenic and androgenic hormones gingerly, for example, if there's marked decalcification of bones from lying in bed. What one really treats in the aging are the chronic diseases of the mind and body which occur with greater and greater frequency in elderly persons. Of course, a few differences exist due to differences in the physiological state, but they are not, to my way of thinking, anywhere near great enough to warrant developing a separate medical specialty. I should like to enumerate a few specific little points in which therapy may differ because they help in a certain way to set off the real lack of difference in mode of medical treatment for young and old. For example, diarrhea with the consequent dehydration is apt to induce, collapse a shock like state and sometimes even nitrogen retention much more quickly and much more frequently in elderly people than in robust adults. Old people behave a little more like children. The thing to do, of course, is to see to it that fluid loss is quickly replaced by mouth if possible, and if not, by vein. Secondly, extreme changes of temperature are very difficult for elderly persons to bear. An oldster's neurovascular system does not regulate temperature as well as a young adult. A very common example of this is the fact that heat stroke occurs with much greater frequency in the aged or in the debilitated person. Another example is that in the event of an [inaudible] stoke, a hemiplegia with loss of speech, when the acute event has subsided, make the patient read aloud. I say read aloud to himself. It is one of the most economic and certain ways of recovering speech. It takes the place of a full-time speech expert in many instances. Of course, this works as well in young people, but strokes are rarely encountered in the young. Never allow an elderly patient to remain in bed one minute longer than is absolutely essential for the treatment of the particular disease from which he suffers. Take the development of bronchopneumonia, for example. Of course, the appropriate antibiotics are given, but unless the patient is too weak, it is good practice to get him up in a chair, if possible, even if fever is present. At least, the patient must be turned frequently in bed and perhaps the head of the bed raised for certain periods during the day. And now I think it well to point out the necessity of different surroundings that are therapeutically important to the care of the aged, although this does concern chronic disease in general, whether the individual is old or young. For an acutely old person who expects his illness to be short, a clean, comfortable hospital bed is all he needs. For a person suffering from a chronic disease, the hospital becomes, however, a sort of home as well as hospital. Here, the attractiveness and spaciousness of the surroundings becomes mighty important to the individual's happiness. In fact, even to his will to live. I could go on numerating many such little details in the treatment of the aged, but as I have said, there is basically little difference in the treatment of a given disease in young and old. Congestive heart failure due to old rheumatic valvular disease in a lad 25 years old and congestive heart failure due to arterioscorotic [phonetic] heart disease in a man of 70 are still treated in the same way. Rest, digitalus [phonetic], mercurial diuretics, a low-salt diet, and perhaps now even the use of the cationic exchanging rosins. Let us, therefore, turn our attention to the other large aspects of the nature of the problem of the aged in public health. The problem of aging in public health is mainly social and economic rather than medical. What is to be done for them? The chronic hospitals are not large enough, the old age homes are not big enough, and why should our elders be confined to hospitals and homes? Yet, the children of these elders come to have space for them less and less frequently as the homes and apartments grow smaller. It is a problem of the whole community. Perhaps ways and means of keeping many of these individuals at home should be diligently sought. Well, for those who, persons who need medical attention, one step in keeping them at home has been taken which shows great promise. Following the example of what was called a home care program at [inaudible] Hospital, the Department of Hospitals of New York City initiated such a program in 1948. Home care means, as Dr. Coval, commissioner of hospitals, has put it, not to discharge the patient from the hospital but simply to transfer him to ward home. Appropriate visits by nurses and from the hospital staff of physicians are made. The patient may be brought back to the hospital at specific times for tests or for therapeutic procedures or because of a change in condition for the worse. The patient is not discharged from the hospital but is simply living at home and cared for at home by the same doctors who took care of him in the hospital, and he may be brought back to the hospital at any time without the red tape of a readmission. Dr. Coval and Dr. Frankel have recently reported on the five-year progress of this plan in the "Journal of the American Hospital Association". The plan has grown steadily, both in the number of hospitals participating in it and the proportion of patients from each hospital on home care. The program appears to have afforded considerable relief to our overcrowded hospitals. In 1948, our city hospitals were operating at 102.4 percent of capacity, which means badly overcrowded. I believe voluntary hospitals run best at approximately 85 percent capacity. Doctors Coval and Frankel state that the hospitals are now in 1953 operating at 95 percent instead of the 102 percent capacity. This mock reduction in crowding may be largely attributed to home care. The roster of patients on home care has grown to almost 2,000 and represents approximately 16 percent of the entire load of the department of hospitals. In other words, the same hospitals are obviously caring for more patients. In fact, the report estimates that if home care had not been instituted, the hospitals of the department would now be operating at an occupancy of about 114 percent, an almost unthinkable degree of overcrowding. Home care was soon found to be also much cheaper. This is the second important result of the program. The authors have estimated the obvious cost at $1.58 per day per patient as against $8.69 per patient per day in a chronic hospital. They point out that even if hidden costs for which they could not account doubled this estimate, there would still be a substantial saving in cost of care. Lastly, and perhaps most important of all, the program appears to afford distinctly better therapy, medically and psychologically. The patient obtains a change of scenery, he sees the family, tastes home life again, and avoids the mental shock of having to be readmitted to a hospital because he had never been discharged or regarded as cured. I have had the opportunity of following a number of patients on this program. Their happiness [inaudible] is all too evident. I should like to cite a few concrete examples. A cardiac patient, just barely able to stay free of edema and pulmonary congestion, may often to taking all of the medicines we now know for the use in, of heart, of congestive heart failure, and be sent home safely. This is apparent for many reasons. The regular visits of the nurse and doctor ensure that the patient takes his digitalus as prescribed. If mercurial diuretics are necessary to maintain compensation, injections can be given at home. Moreover, there are now effective safe preparations of mercurial diuretics which can be taken by mouth at home. Teaching the cardiac to maintain a reasonably salt poor diet also helps a lot. Then for another example patients with Parkinsonism have had to be put in the hospital because the tremor was severe enough to interfere with self-care and feeding. Now, often the tremor can be sufficiently controlled with the new anti-spasmatic drugs to allow them to go home for longer periods of time. Patients suffering from cirrhosis of the liver, although they may still have [inaudible], have been sent home. If they have been taught in the hospital what a good high protein, high caloric diet really is, and if they are improving, they may profitably continue their convalescence at home. One patient, suffering from Buerger's disease for more than twenty years, had been in hospitals almost continually for five years. For three years, she was actually in the hospital all the time because of development of gangrene of the toes, ulceration of the feet, and severe muscular pain due to arterial insufficiency. After more than a year on some of the modern adrenergic blocking agents, the circulation improved, the ulcers healed, and the pain subsided sufficiently to allow her to be transferred to ward home where she is now happily engaged in part-time secretarial work. But all this is only a small part of the main problem. Mainly, the care of the large group of indigent or nearly indigent well old people. Certain steps have been taken here. The Social Security Act of 1935 has been steadily enlarged to include more and more types of workers in old age assistance, but the monthly pension is small, and like many insurance policies, discourages anybody below the age of 75 from working. This Act is a great step forward, but it is certainly only a partial answer to the problem. As a [inaudible] to the old age assistance program, it would seem that furnishing rent-free homes to old people, particularly old couples, is a very economic way of increasing the usefulness of the Social Security benefits.

And income of $65 a month for an elderly couple is hopelessly inadequate if they pay $40 rent, but if they were given a place to live, a smaller cash benefit might cover their expenses easily. What I am trying to say is that there are other benefits than straight cash for the aged which may, in the long run, be a more economic kind of aid. Another important point was made in 1951 by the New York State Joint Legislative Committee on the problems of aging. Ever since 1870, the proportion of men over 65 years of age in the labor market has been steadily declining. In 1870, about eighty percent were in the labor market. Today, it is only half that figure. Attempts to reverse this trend seem to me the most important field of endeavor in this whole problem. To give emphasis to the importance of trying to stop this trend, I should like to quote from a report by Kenneth J. Kelly of the Legislative Agent [inaudible] of Massachusetts Federation of Labor to our own New York State Committee. "The gap between life expectancy and work life expectancy according to the figures that I have received indicate that from 1900 to 1950, man's life expectancy increased ten years, but his work life expectancy increased only three years, and that gap may continue to increase." Now in all sense, what use is there in increasing the span of life without increasing the length of the individual's usefulness? That is where the large proportion of the older men who have disappeared from the labor market is situated. And then Mr. Kelly goes on. "Jobs, in the final analysis, are much better than charity or public welfare, and I think that the skills, the loyalty, the maturity of the older worker are badly needed and are going to be badly needed at this particular time. A society that neglects the needs of its older workers is, thereby, undermining its own stability." To employ in jobs suited to their capabilities, the many elderly who are lonely, bored, and want to work is really the area of greatest. Maybe they have great skill and experience but cannot work at quite so fast a rate as younger people. What reason is there not to employ them, perhaps on a somewhat lower wage or salary, if that seems fair, than that which they earned before retirement, but by all means employ them? Employers' notions that hiring old people make them liable to greater insurance and pension costs as well as union wage scales have helped force the retirement of people over 65. Now here, practitioners of medicine may well be in a position to help. Among their patients must be many an employer, large and small. Also among their patients may be elderly patients who have sought the doctor out because of minor complaints, and the origin of these complaints may well be only due to boredom or frustration from the very lack of employment. Surely, it's within the physician providence to point out to his employer patient the possibility of employing his well overaged patient. Surely, it is within his province and even perhaps his duty to certify to the health of his overaged patient with minor complaints and urge their employment. Where it is difficult to believe that everyone wants just security. That is to say enough money to live in idleness from 65 years to the age of, to death. Then, in the field of getting old, of the solutions of our problems. The New York State Committee reports in detail how this problem is being brought to the attention of employers, of unions, and of life insurance companies. One report also emphasizes the importance of encouraging self-employment. It tells of the success attending the New York Women's Program where many an elderly woman has been encouraged in self-employment. One, to set herself up in the mayonnaise business quite successfully; another, age 72, to start a sandwich catering business; and so on. Examples can be cited of many persons who re-employ themselves on a little bit of encouragement. Encouragement. [Inaudible] on a little bit of encouragement. On a little bit of encouragement. On a little bit of, the problem also making great strides in writing contracts with labor to help keep able old people employed, but the problem needs to be stated again and again in order to continually find new ways of employing the elderly. Every one of us can help. The health and happiness of millions of people is at stake. Now I should like to conclude with a short summary. The [inaudible]. Well old and then the great problem of the well old person without means of subsistence. [Inaudible] by the Department of Hospitals of New York City that partially incapacitated old people can often be cared for at home by the hospital staff for long periods. This program, called the Home Care Program, has been shown to be economically sound, has served in essence to increase the capacity of the hospitals by 16 percent, and, most important, and to solve it involves the help of legislators, social workers, economists, and physicians [inaudible], and physicians [inaudible], and physicians [inaudible], and physicians [inaudible], and physician, for care of chronically ill old people. Two, to build [inaudible] increase Social Security. Three, to increase Social Security [inaudible] low rent or free housing. Perhaps most important of all to make a great effort to [inaudible] the employment of people who [inaudible] concerning self-employment. [Inaudible] physicians can help greatly in this task. I thank you.
