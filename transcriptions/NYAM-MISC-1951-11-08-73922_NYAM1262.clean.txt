>> Iago Galdston: I trust you will bear with me if I intrude upon you for a few minutes [inaudible] about the New York Academy of Medicine and to serve as a kind of introducer to our librarian Miss Janet Doe. The paper scheduled for this evening is on the topic pregnancy, and that will be delivered by Dr. Myron E. [inaudible]. Subject went to his address. You will hear Miss Doe, the librarian of the New York Academy of Medicine, tell you something about the library and about the services, which are available in and through the library, to the public and the profession of greater New York. My excuse for intruding upon you is simply this. The New York Academy of Medicine, which is more than a hundred years old and which has done some splendid work both in the city and for the nation as a whole, is oddly enough and much to our dismay, I might say, [inaudible] is fully known to the profession as we feel it ought to be. And consequently, we have decided, our committee and directors of the Academy, to introduce periodically in these addresses some of the people who are working with us in the Academy to continue a little bit about what is being done in the various departments of our institution, to serve the profession and to serve the public. I am particularly happy that this introduction is to be given by Miss Doe. Our library really is one of the distinguished features of the New York Academy of Medicine and, I might say, is one of the oldest of the divisions of the New York Academy of Medicine. It is a beautiful institution apart from its utilitarian aspects. And I hope that you will pay close attention to what Miss Doe has to say about the library and accept her invitation to make use of its facilities and to visit, in particular, our very beautiful and very interesting rare bookroom. Thank you.
