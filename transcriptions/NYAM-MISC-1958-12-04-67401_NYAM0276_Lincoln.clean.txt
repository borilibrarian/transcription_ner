>> Joseph N. Nathanson: Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, my first present of duty is to thank you for the [inaudible] honor of being your speaker this evening. I realize what a difficult task this could be for me to equal the high standard set by those who have addressed you in the past. I must also admit that a few days after I had accepted your kind invitation, I was inclined to communicate with your chairman and request that I be allowed to withdraw my acceptance. The reason for this r in my attitude was due to the fact that certain parts of the [inaudible] which I have studied in my youth began to plague me by the very nature of their contents which refer in rather [inaudible] terms to members of my profession in general and to my specialty in particular. The [inaudible] is that vast store house of a brave culture both religious and secular, ranging from pure dogma through ethics, morals, law governing the state of land, folklore, medicine, pungent humor, and a host of other avenues of information and learning which constitutes the constitutions made by the stages of the pre-Christian era. To knowledge in general, and to he who [inaudible] in particular, in one of the many [inaudible] devoted to women the public is advised not to dwell in the town where the leader of the community is a physician. Particular admiration is given about my own specialty of genecology for it is fading that quote, "One who's business is with women must never be left alone with women," likewise the [inaudible] states the quote, "He who's business with women has a bad character." And elaborating further about the blood letters, a synonym for us physicians if is said that, "Ten things I've said of a blood letter, he walks on his side as a conceited spirit and leans back when sitting, he has a grudging eye and an evil eye, he needs much and should even be subscripted of adultery, robbery and bloodshed." Finally as if these were not sufficiently severe condemnations listen to the [inaudible] as it appears in the same [inaudible], the best of doctors are destined for hell. Do you still wonder why I approach my assignment this evening with [inaudible] of an indescribable character and now with [inaudible] dripping from my shoulders, I hope you will find some interest in what I shall try to tell you about Abraham Lincoln's Contact with the Doctors. Abraham Lincoln occupies a unique place in biographic literature, but [inaudible] biblical characters nor to be Jesus, Moses, and the leading profits more have been written about him than any other individual in the history of the human race. This is attested to by the fact that to date more than five -- 6500 books and pamphlets in English and 34 foreign languages have been published on or about Lincoln; this does not include the tens of thousands of magazines and newspaper articles, unpublished sermons, eulogy's addresses and so forth. The reason for such a prolific bibliography about the great liberator is that he studied [inaudible] light; it's unusually engrossing either to the casual reader or to the serious student. The constant addition of printed material is ample proof that the Lincoln theme has not yet been exhausted, my presence objective is to present a phase of his life from an infrequently mentioned vista namely, Abraham Lincoln's contacts with the doctors. In the vast majority of cases, the very first contact with an individual hand with a physician is at the time of his birth when the appending [inaudible] dives in into this troubled world. In the case of Lincoln this does not hold true. It appears that his father Thomas Lincoln who was scrupulously honest was unwilling to quote "run up the debt with a physician in [inaudible] Kentucky to whom he was already under financial obligation." Accordingly arrangements were made with the best-known mid-wife in the community, Mrs. Mary [inaudible] of [inaudible] Creek to be in attendance at the blessed event. Because she was occupied in another home she sent her young niece and assistant Mrs. Peggy Walters, assisted by two of Nancy Hanks -- distanced aunts, the husky Abraham was ushered into the world and its surroundings of a known primitive character. There is no record of the poor or the duration of the labor, but it can be assumed that no competition presented themselves on that [inaudible] day February the 12th, 1809. During his early childhood the young Abraham enjoyed unusually good health to a such a degree as to obviate the necessity of any medical care. In his tenth year while trying to stimulate a horse to move more stiffly by the use of a hook, the old grey mare retaliated with her hind feet which knocked the lively boy unconscious for many hours. There is reason to believe that this might have caused a fracture of the skull for a study of Lincoln's facemask shows a depression on the forehead, even without medical care the boy recovered and grown to be an unusually powerful man. In 1832 while living in New Salem, Lincoln was defeated for election in the state legislature of Illinois, this political reversal together with the difficulty of earning a livelihood caused him to exhibit signs of a mental depression of such severity as to worry his friends. This is apparently the first of many episodes of depression of which Lincoln [inaudible] are aware. In the spring of 1833 Dr. Jason Dunkin of New Salem in conjunction with other friends, maneuvered things in such a manner as to [inaudible] an appointment position as village postmaster. In addition to [inaudible] to his health the doctor gave him a poem correctly called mortality or why should the spirit of mortal be proud. Dr. Dunkin saw it in a newspaper, cut it out and gave it to Lincoln. Who committed it to memory and thereafter referred to it as his favorite poem, throughout his remaining years he resorted to [inaudible] especially when he was in a melancholy mood. On innumerable occasions he entertained his friends by reciting it, the poem was written by a young scotch man William Knox, who was born in 1789 and died in 1825. It's [inaudible] are humility and the expendability of man. Both of which appeal to Lincoln for they constitute about family attributes of his sterling character, in 1835 following the death of his devoted friend Ann [inaudible], Lincoln suffered in the pack of mental depression of such a degree that his friend showed considerable alarm for his reason. It was at this time that a physician and good friend Dr. John Allen took charge of him, not only was he a skillful physician but also a wise counselor to his patients, soon there was established a mutual affection between them. Dr. Allen was a graduate of Dartmouth College, he received the [inaudible] degree that he compromised the difficulty and pain in the practice of medicine [inaudible] by donating all he received on that day to his church. The influence that this disposition exerted is affirmed by the fact that Lincoln credited him with formulating his opposition for liquor. In addition there's a side of anti-slavery principles caused Dr. Allen to exert a greater moral influence than all the preachers in the community especially upon Abraham Lincoln. Following the courtship which did not [inaudible] in marriage with Mary O. in 1836, Lincoln suffered his third attack of depression, but fortunately it was a short duration and he enjoyed good health for a few years thereafter. On January the 1st 1841 on which date his marriage to Mary Todd was scheduled, the engagement came to an abrupt end, it appears that this was precipitated by fear on the part of the shy introspective Lincoln. You to the differences and the humble [inaudible], lack of formal schooling and poor financial standing as compared to the aristocrat cultures and socially prominent background of his fiance. [Inaudible] a profound and despondency, if intimate friends were forced to keep sharp instruments such as knives and razors away from him because Lincoln himself, feared the danger of suicide. For that reason he is said not to have carried even a pocketknife for many years thereafter, in a short time Lincoln communicated with Dr. Daniel [inaudible] who was the dean of the medical department for the college of Cincinnati. And who enjoyed a splendid reputation throughout the western parts of the world -- of the country, in a rather lengthy letter the distress Lincoln described his symptoms and requested Dr. [inaudible] to prescribe appropriate [inaudible]. However, the [inaudible] positions informed him that this would be impossible without a personal interview and a subtle physical examination. It is unfortunate that Lincoln did not accept the physician's advice; a record of a physical and neurological examination by such an outstanding authority would have been a great value to students of Lincoln's who are particularly interested in his medical background. Claiming to obtain care from Dr. [inaudible], a lifelong intimate association was established between Lincoln and his friend and local medical advisor Dr. [inaudible] of Springfield, Illinois. Lincoln's self [inaudible] to Henry was necessary towards existence at the time of his great emotional disturbance after that faithful [inaudible] of January 1841. Dr. Henry was born a rich [inaudible] New York in 1804, he received a common school education and studied medicine with a local physician. In 1826 he went to Cincinnati where he completed his medical education on the previously mentioned and renowned Dr. Daniel [inaudible]. Early in his life he displayed a flare for politics which he followed throughout his entire career, at various times he was interested in [inaudible], teaching school and conducting a drug store business. He resumed the practice of medicine is Springfield, Illinois in October 1832 and soon gained the reputation for being an expert in the [inaudible] which he then correctly assumed was not contagious. Why medicine with a chief means of livelihood for the next 22 years, politics was always his key interest, he was recognized as a wiz leader in Springfield along with Lincoln, Johnson, Stewart and others. He took an active part as one of the food commissioners to superintend the election of the state house in Springfield in 1837. His medical practice however suffered because Dr. Henry devoted too much of his time to politics, as a result -- as a reward for his political activities he appointed an Indian agent in [inaudible] by [inaudible] in 1850. Soon after he arrived on the west coast he began to take an active part in [inaudible] politics and became the leader of the [inaudible] in that part of the country. He ensured that the fort of the northwest to uphold a nomination of Lincoln for President by the republican national committee in May 1860. In 1861 Lincoln rewarded his lifelong friend by appointing him the mayor general of Washington territory which included the present states of Washington, Idaho and the western part of Montana. Dr. Henry lost his life at sea off the Oregon coast of California while returning to his home in the state of Washington from New York in the summer of 1865. Only a few months after the death of a [inaudible] friend, Abraham Lincoln, following Lincoln's breakdown in January 1841, Dr. Henry diagnosed his ailment as [inaudible] most popularly termed [inaudible] by student of present day medicine. On the advice of its physician, Lincoln spent several weeks on the southern plantation of his intimate friend Joshua .F. Speed in Louisville, Kentucky, as a result of this change of scene and climate he was restored to good health. In addition, due to Dr. Henry showed guidance the introvert Lincoln and the extrovert Mary Todd were united and married at Springfield on November the 4th, 1842. As would be expected, the first important medical events concerning a newly married couple would be the birth of their first child, from time to time it has been intimated that Abraham Lincoln's attacks of depression were due to and certainly aggravated by the fear that he was deficient sexually. This assumption can be dismissed similarly for there is ample proof that his virility was of a very high order, with this the fact that his first child Robert Todd Lincoln was born at the globe tavern in Springfield on August the 1st, 1843, just 270 days after the wedding. It was at this hotel that the Lincoln [inaudible] about one year after their marriage for four dollars a week for room and board. Mary Lincoln on the other hand would have no need for consulting a gynecologist for the closure of the fallopian tubes or other factors [inaudible] with her fertility. In a space of less than 11 years she gave birth to four living male children, thus far one has been unable to alert active and detailed information about the course of her pregnancy, the duration and character of her labor, and other data that would interest us as [inaudible] and gynecologists. However, in the past two years [inaudible] has shown that at the birth of her last child on April the 4th 1853 Mary Lincoln suffered an injury of a vaginal tract of sufficient severity to cause her great discomfort for the rest of her life. It is difficult to conclude whether this was a prolapse of the uterus, a [inaudible] vaginal [inaudible] or a rectal vaginal [inaudible], in any event it is apparent that the fame and skill of [inaudible] the founder of the woman's hospital in New York was unknown to the Lincoln's. Since the father of modern [inaudible] was successfully posing as [inaudible] vaginal [inaudible] as early as 1848, no record is available to show whether Mrs. Lincoln was delivered by physician's or mid-wives, although it is certain that Lincoln had friends who were recognized as able physician in the Springfield community. Among these maybe mentioned Dr. John Todd, his wife's uncle and Dr. William Wallace, his brother-in-law, of the medical men of Lincoln's early days of Springfield or the well known physician Dr. [inaudible] and Dr. [inaudible] who was also respected for [inaudible] capabilities and Dr. [inaudible] who was recognized as a naval [inaudible]. Dr. [inaudible] was also a very close friend of Lincoln who appointed him a [inaudible] governor of what is now Montana, Idaho, and the Dakota's in the early age of 35 years in 1861. Dr. [inaudible] died in 1916 at the ripe old age of 90 years. There is ample evidence that Lincoln had [inaudible] relations and claimed intimate with numerous other physicians, not only in Springfield, but in other parts of the state of Illinois. The most serious illness that confronted any member of the Lincoln family during their residence in Springfield was in the attack of [inaudible] from which their second child Edward died on February the 1st1850 after an illness of 15 days. Both Lincoln and his wife suffered grief at the loss of their beloved son, and this [inaudible] in Springfield on February the 11th, 1861, on his way to Washington for his inauguration. Eleven years after the tragedy he again mentions the death of his child. During their residence in Springfield the Lincoln family in accordance to local customs purchased many home remedies in time of illness from a drug store. It appears that their patronage was extended almost exclusively to the [inaudible] drug store, a [inaudible] of this establishment for the years 1857 to 1859 disclosed an interesting entry in the account of Abraham Lincoln. It contains an item known as the "dead shot," and further research shows that this was used to eradicate a certain type of livestock which knows no social barriers. To those who have [inaudible] advanced biology, it would be designated by the technical term [inaudible], but there [inaudible] in Boston, race week in Philadelphia, or the [inaudible], it would be known under the generic term of bed bugs. While tagging along a series of [inaudible] debates with Steven Douglas in the summer and fall of 1858, Lincoln began to show the same on mind and body, after he had finished his speech of [inaudible] Illinois on October the 15th 1858 he almost collapsed from sheer exhaustion. He was taken by his friends to his room in the hotel, tipped by George P. Floyd and his wife, after he had been placed on the lounge, later remarked "I tell you I'm mighty [inaudible] petered out, I reckon I'll have to quit to give up the race." Mrs. Floyd who was standing and watching him was a great believer in old school remedies and suggested Mr. Lincoln be treated with a rum sweat. "Rum sweat," said Lincoln, "Well, I never drank a drop of liquor in my life," "You don't have to drink the rum," replied Mrs. Floyd, "it's an external treatment." Well said Lincoln, "If you think it'll do me any good just crack your whip and go ahead, any point in this storm I tell you I might be overboard," the treatment was administered as directed by Mrs. Floyd. The [inaudible] and rum was placed under a cane seated chair, the patient was stiff seated in the chair and covered over with blankets, there in the rum was set on fire, the fumes or vapors of the rum caused perfuse perspiration. After which the patient was put to bed, covered with woolen blankets and given a concoction of hot ginger tea, the sweating continued. The next morning to the surprise of his friend, Lincoln made his appearance bright and early, when asked how he was feeling he replied, "Why I feel as a two year old, I can jump a five rail fence right now, [inaudible], I heard of folks drinking liquor and rubbing their bodies with the bottle for ailment. But I never heard of drinking the stuff with a [inaudible] to get a man full, if Mrs. Floyd would only join us in the campaign of this fight for me I think we could beat [inaudible] slick and clean." Lincoln had such a distressing experience with a dentist in Louisville in 1841 that it prepared him to any [inaudible] which might arise in the years to come, it appears that following a non to [inaudible] extraction of a tooth, he suffered severe pain. Unquestionably [inaudible] of the jaw developed and persisted for a considerable length of time, joy did not follow filled with spontaneous excursion of a piece of bone occurred. Accordingly when the need for another extraction arose in 1862 the alert Lincoln consulted one of the leading dentists that the [inaudible] of Washington. Just as he was about to adjust the forceps, the President was [inaudible] the dentist to postpone action until he took the few deep inhalations from a bottle that he took out from under his pocket, he then gave the signal to proceed and the operation was performed almost painlessly. Dr. [inaudible] later stated that the bottle contained [inaudible], it is evident that the sedation of Lincoln practiced the art of anesthesia on himself long before [inaudible] by the [inaudible] and medical profession. On the basis of this incident I trust that I shall be pardoned for being so bold, after [inaudible] the opinion that since Lincoln did not [inaudible] natural tooth extraction most certainly he would not at this state seek admission to the rights of the very [inaudible] and their enthusiastic practice of natural child birth. On his trip from Springfield to Washington for his inauguration the President's elect physical welfare was entrusted to Mrs. Lincoln's brother-in-law Dr. William Wallace after whom their third child Willy was named. Immediately following the democracy of the White House and soon after assuming the duties of the presidency, Abraham Lincoln selected Dr. [inaudible] a prominent physician of Washington and a member of a medical association since 1851 as his family physician. Dr. [inaudible] was born in Washington in 1822, and at the age of 20 he received his [inaudible] from Princeton University in 1842. He pursued his medical studies at the University of Pennsylvania from which he was graduated in 1845 with a degree of doctor of medicine, he then went to [inaudible] for post graduate studies at the [inaudible] Indiana, paying particular attention to the eyes and ears. After his return to Washington in 1847 he was appointed professor of anatomy physiology at the Columbia medical college, from 1851 to 1861 he was Professor of Clinical Surgery at the National Medical College and President of the Board of Health of the District of Columbia. As a result of a fractured hip incurred in 1860, Dr. Stone limited his practice thereafter [inaudible] hospital, and office work, he died of [inaudible] on April the 23rd, 1872 at the early age of 50. Colleagues respected Abe for his broad mindedness, [inaudible], and high professional attainment, it is significant to note that despite political differences Lincoln disregarded party affiliations and chose Dr. Stone as his own physician. Solely on the bases of his personal and professional qualifications, [inaudible] of death of 12 year old Willy on February the 20th, 1862 from [inaudible] pneumonia, there was little Celia still within the Lincoln family ruling their residence in the White House. The death of their favorite child proved to be a horrific shock to both President Lincoln and his wife. As a result Lincoln again entered into a pity of a profound grief and despondency, on the Thursday of each week whichever week following the tragedy he would lock himself in his own darkened room, pace the floor and abstain from all food or drink. Resulting to dedicate every Thursday to grief for his own and other fathers sons who died because of the Civil War, following the intervention of a friend as the reverend [inaudible] of trinity church [inaudible], Lincoln abandoned his foolish resolve and assured that tactful and persuasive [inaudible] that there would be no more mourning Thursdays. There is ample evidence to indicate that the influence which the reverend [inaudible] upon Abraham Lincoln produced a great spiritual change in him, thereafter he would [inaudible] of mental depression; he seemed to have acquired a religious faith and spiritual uplift following the death of his beloved Willy. At this point [inaudible] who have expressed an opinion generally accepted at the present time, "In some emotional crisis a religious mentor may be able to provide more important support than standard psychiatrist." Dr. [inaudible] a devious student of Lincoln recently completed a careful study and analysis of Lincoln's life and emotional reactions, as a result of this study he concludes that Lincoln at heart quote "was both a mystic and a scientist, a combination not conclusive to a [inaudible]," that means middle of the road personality. Since [inaudible] on mental abnormality can be defined as a progressive [inaudible] of the personality, it is at once clear that this definition could never be applied to Lincoln, the father, the lawyer, the politician, and the statesman. To quote the [inaudible] psychiatrist Dr. [inaudible] once more, because he is an outstanding feature and premonition of fixed and experienced, I should like to bring to your attention the board definition of he is a elaborator of the term normal, as a construction of average behavior. In these words, "A psychiatrist uses these terms to infer to a wide range of behavior, he does not limit it use of the opposite of sickness and pathology, all the actions, the outcome of our struggles, our loves and our hates are determined by many factors, so many that no two of us behaves identically, we differ not so much in the qualitative factors of our personalities as in the very [inaudible] and the modifications of the characteristics that are common to all of us." For instance, every man has some love for himself, some men have some love for other people and things, but it is the quantity of self-love that differentiates the normal from abnormal personalities. Wide variations make the concept of normality somewhat intangible and therefore of relatively minor significance as a measure of mental health, and, "end quote. On the basis of this clear and logical explanation, we must admit the truth that we can recall certain persons, [inaudible] or historical with peculiar variations of emotional behavior including ourselves and Abraham Lincoln." [Inaudible] emotional disturbances [inaudible] by a sense of humor, physical activity, self-discipline and ordinary common sense, in the last analysis there was nothing really abnormal about Lincoln. If [inaudible] emotions were confused at the approaches of marriage, marriage cured him, if he suffered from slightly neurotic tendencies his own recognition of his healing of his condition with a healing factor. Therefore he was a depressive type of slightly neurotic manner, but that at no time did he pass the bound of so called normality, on November the 19th, 1863 Lincoln delivered his immortal Gettysburg Address, while returning to Washington he complained of feeling ill and suffered from a severe headache. Which necessity to the application of cold to his head, he was confined to the lighthouse from November the 20th to the middle of December and was ordered to remain in bed for a considerable time. His medical attendant Dr. Robert K. Stone made a diagnoses of [inaudible], a mild form of smallpox acquired by the partially immune. The lighthouse was not quarantined but during his respite the President took advantage to rid himself of many undesirable office seekers who beseeched him constantly for political favors, using the smallpox scare to advantage at which Lincoln remarked, "Now, I have something that I can give to everybody." Parenthetically it is interesting to note the clarity and nobility of expression in this sublime Gettysburg Address which is regarded as one of the gems of English literature and one of the outstanding examples of jurisdiction in our language, it must be considered as one of the greatest [inaudible] of all time. No other address except the [inaudible] delivered in 430 BC in eulogy of the heroes of the [inaudible] war [inaudible] comparison with it, it consists of only 267 words of which 46 are about one-sixth of Latin origin, the remaining five sixth are Angel Saxon. Compare the [inaudible] and eloquent simplicity of one who's entire form of schooling did not exceed six months to the [inaudible] of the long haired boys in the [inaudible] days of the new deal, with their heavy [inaudible] dangling from their watch chains. They had to resort to more than six thousand words for an OPA directive to regulate the price of cabbage and garlic for [inaudible] Massachusetts. The pre-assessor of the American Red Cross society was known as the United States sanitary commission during the Civil War, it's offices received those salary for their services and they often paid their own traveling expenses. Basically it's functions and objectives corresponded very closely to those now assumed by the Red Cross, it's cheap source of income with sanitary fairs which were conducted throughout the entire north, President Lincoln's interest in and generosity to the [inaudible] commission is shown by his presentation to it of many autograph writings which were to be sold at these fairs. Of the more important contributions which he made were the original manuscripts of his valuable state papers and several copies of the Gettysburg Address, the original draft of the proclamation of emancipation was sold for $3,000 at the first sanitary fair which was conducted in Chicago in October and November 1863. Unfortunately it was burned in the great Chicago fire in 1871, in answer to an appeal made by the ladies of the army relief bizarre in Albany, New York the President presented the preliminary copies of the proclamation of emancipation, it was sold for $1100 to Jared Smith and the money was turned over to the United States sanitary commission. This copy is now preserved in the archives of the state of New York. The highest theme in which Lincoln held the sanitary commission because of its fine humanitarian accomplishments is proven by his visits to the cemetery [inaudible] in Washington in 1864. It was one of the very few instances where he attended a political gathering during his presidency, in the short speech which he delivered he made a special effort to show his appreciation to the women who sponsored the work of the commission by closing his remarks with quote "God bless the women of America." On April the 9th 1865 [inaudible] surrendered [inaudible] and the Civil War came to a close, for the following five days during the period of Thanksgiving, and the celebration the close of hostility, President Lincoln showed a complete change physically and emotionally. His pale haggard face was transfigured into one of joy, on the evening of Friday April the 14th, 1865 in company with his wife and intuitively young friends while attending a play at Ford's theatre he was shot by John Welks Booth at 22 minutes past 10 o'clock. The assassin used a single shot derringer pistol which was very destructive at close range, the bullet which was not made of lead but of [inaudible] metal, a hard alloy of tin, copper and [inaudible] entered the left side of the skull behind the ear. The deadly missile is now preserved in the archives of the war department, the first physician to respond to call for medical help was Dr. Charles .A. [inaudible] who was in the audience at the time. He was 23 years of age and an assistant surgeon in the United States volunteers, it is doubtful that one so young in our profession was ever called upon to render professional services under more dramatic or more important hospices. As soon as he reached the President who seemed to be dead, Dr. [inaudible] ordered that he be moved from the chair in which he was sitting while he was shot and allowed to recline on the floor; no pulse was [inaudible]. He found a large clot of blood on the left shoulder and at first he thought this was due to a dagger wound, however, on lifting the eyelid he discovered evidence of a brain injury conferring by the presence of a wound in the back of the head. [inaudible] pressure was eased by removing the clot, the physician then attempt to stimulate respiration by pressure on the tongue to free the [inaudible] secretions, artificial respiration of cardiac stimulation was then carried out at first by pressure on the diaphragm followed in the short while by forcible in and out breathing into the President's mouth. This brought about cardiac and pulmonary action without much further aid. Further calls for the medical assistance brought Dr. Charles .S. Taft assistant surgeon in the United States volunteers and Dr. Charles F.A. King to the President's box. Brandy was then administered and he swallowed it without much difficulty, however, 20 minutes later a second attempt was made to give him more of a stimulant but it was unsuccessful. As soon as the danger of the immediate death appeared to have passed it was suggested by bystanders that the President be removed to the White House, this was overruled by the physicians who insisted on moving him the shortest possible distance. Accordingly he was carried across the street to the rented room of one William Clark who was a boarder in the house of William Petersen about 15 minutes after the shooting. Because of the President's great height it was necessary to place him diagonally across the bed in which he was allowed to rest in a propped up position. Following the removal of his clothing, failing to find any other wounds, [inaudible] were applied over the [inaudible] and several other parts of the body, additional external heat was supplied by the use of hot water bottles and blankets. The head was now examined and probed with the finger, but this failed to locate the bullet. Further attempts to administer Brandy but not to [inaudible] because it caused choking and appeared to be retaining in the throat. Shortly after his removal from the theater, the Lincoln family physician Dr. Robert Keystone [assumed spelling] and Dr. Joseph K. Barnes, the Surgeon General of the United States Army arrived and took charge of their distinguished patient. At 2:00 a.m. at the [inaudible] the Surgeon General attempted to locate the bullet, but the [inaudible] silver probe was found to be too short. It was [inaudible] probe he [inaudible] the bullet a few inches beyond. He did not try to remove it. As he passed it he was confronted with segments of the right orbital plate of the frontal [inaudible]. The probe was then withdrawn and no further attempts to explore the injury were made. The task of keeping an accurate chart of the condition of the dying President [inaudible] who made 33 different notations of the pulse, respiration, symptoms of immediate dissolution and death. Of the 16 physicians who were at the President's bedside at some time during the last hour's of his life [inaudible] mention the following [inaudible] of Washington. Dr. Neil Hall, Dr. Charles H. Leiberman [assumed spelling], Dr. William Henry Ford, [inaudible] and Dr. Edward W. Abbott [assumed spelling]. The following is a verbatim report of the surgeon's bedside notes of President Lincoln's last hours on April the 15th, 1865. "The surgical aide that could be rendered consisted in keeping the external [inaudible] of the wound free from coagulum and promoting the discharge of blood and brain tissue. While the discharge kept up, the brain of the patient was quiet and easy, but the moment the wound closed from any cause the breathing became at once labored [inaudible]. The pulse of the President fluctuated between 40 and 60 during the night and varied in volume and force, sometimes being quite full and strong and then [inaudible] and feeble. After 5:00 a.m. the pulse remained at about 60, but became gradually weaker and thinner from that time until his death. The wound ceased to bleed and discharge about 5:30 a.m., and from that time the breathing was [inaudible], but gradually increased in frequency and decreased in strength up to the last breath, which was drawn at 21 minutes and 55 seconds after 7:00. The heart did not cease to beat until 22 minutes and 10 seconds past 7:00. My hand was on the President's heart and my eye upon the watch of the Surgeon General who was standing by my side with his finger on the carotid." One minute after the President had been pronounced dead, Edwin [inaudible] Secretary of War, who had always been regarded as a curmudgeon, [inaudible] as hard and as unmoving as granite closed his illustrious [inaudible]. With tears streaming down his stern face and long beard, he turned to those about him and in the ominous silence of the death chamber he uttered those immortal words, "Now he belongs to the ages." A few hours after the President's death an autopsy, which was limited to the contents of the cranial cavity only, was performed in an upper guest room in the northwest wing of the White House at 12 o'clock noon, Saturday, April the 15th, 1865. The following is a verbatim report of the postmortem findings. "Surgeon Generals' office, Washington City, D.C., April the 15th, 1865, Brigadier General J.T. Barnes, Surgeon General United States Army, General, I have the honor to report that [inaudible] and aided by Assistant Surgeon [inaudible] I made in your presence at 12 o'clock this morning an autopsy on the body of President Abraham Lincoln with the following results. The eyelids and surrounding parts of the face were greatly [inaudible] and the eyes somewhat [inaudible] infusion of blood into the orbits. There was a gunshot wound to the head around which the scalp was thickened by hemorrhage into the tissue. The [inaudible] bone and about an inch to the left of the [inaudible] line and just above the left lateral sinus, which it opened. It then penetrated [inaudible], passed through the left lateral ventricle and lodged in the white matter of the cerebrum just above the arterial portion of the [inaudible] where it was found. The wound in the [inaudible] was quite smooth, circular shape with beveled edges. The opening through the internal [inaudible] being larger and through the external [inaudible]. The [inaudible] was full of clotted blood and contained several little fragments of [inaudible] with a small piece of the ball [inaudible]. The brain around the [inaudible] hemorrhage into it's substance. The ventricles of the brain were full of clotted blood. [Inaudible] beneath the [inaudible] the right cerebral lobe. There was a smaller clot under the [inaudible] of the left side, but little blood was found at the base of the brain. Both the orbital [inaudible] of the frontal bone were fractured and the fragments pushed up towards the brain. [Inaudible] with these fractures was uninjured. The [inaudible] gorged with blood." "I have the honor to be very respectfully your obedient servant, A.J. Woodward [assumed spelling], Assistant Surgeon, USA." Thus ended Abraham Lincoln's last contact with the doctors. According to [inaudible] the predominance of present day expert opinion is that the shattered eye sockets were a result of a sudden pressure transmitted to the brain by the bullet, this pressured breaking down the orbital plate at the point of least resistance. As we [inaudible] to the death of Lincoln, we are confronted by the question whether his life could have been saved if those in attendance had possessed present day medical knowledge, aided by advanced new surgical skills, the use of antibiotics and chemotherapy and unlimited [inaudible] for blood transfusion. Aseptic technique as we understand it would have forbidden inserting unwashed fingers into the wound to feel for the bullet, or to relieve compression. Certainly no attempt at probing for or removing the bullet would be [inaudible] while the patient's life was wavering precariously. The use of intravenous [inaudible] and the removal of the blood clots by irrigation with sterile saline solution would have of course have been employed. As a last resort, decompression would be attempted, but it is extremely doubtful if it would be undertaken during the first 24 to 36 hours after the shooting. It is the unqualified opinion of leading neurologists and neurosurgeons who have studied the nature of the injuries inflicted by the assassin's bullet, of this extremely doubtful whether even the best of modern treatments would have saved the martyred President. Assuming that by some miraculous turn he would have survived such immediate complications as meningitis or brain abscess, he would still be confronted with such major remote [inaudible] epilepsy, partial or complete paralysis, total blindness, and permanent or damaged brain injury, all of which would have reduced him to a vegetative existence for the rest of his life. I believe it is appropriate to pose my remarks by recalling what Abraham Lincoln did on the last day of his earthly existence. The termination of a Civil War has brought him that victory for which he was ever ready to lay down his life. Nevertheless, he did not exhibit the conceit or aptitude of indispensability which most rulers or leaders of nations would have shown under similar circumstances of triumph. Even to his last hours he maintained a spirit of humility. He considered the [inaudible] recite his favorite poem to his intimate friends who were in his company at the White House to celebrate the victory of the [inaudible]. Certainly [inaudible] more genuine concept by [inaudible] and practice than Lincoln did in fulfilling the [inaudible] enunciated by the Prophet Micah to do justly, love [inaudible], walk humbly with your God. Thus it is particularly fitting to conclude with a few verses of his favorite poem, "Mortality". It is significant to note, once more, [inaudible] a member of our profession, Dr. Jason Duncan [assumed spelling] who first called Lincoln's attention to it. "Oh why should the spirit of mortal be proud? I [inaudible] meteor, a fast flying cloud, a flash of the lightening, a break of the wave, he passes from life to his rest in the grave. The hand of the [inaudible] has born, the [inaudible] that the miter hath worn, the eye of the sage and the heart of the brave are hidden and lost in the depth of the grave. It is the wink of an eye, it is the draft of a breath, from the blossoms of Hell to the palest of [inaudible], from the [inaudible] to the [inaudible]. Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be crowned."
