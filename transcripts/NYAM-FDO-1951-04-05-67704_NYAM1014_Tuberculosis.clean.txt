>> Good morning ladies and gentlemen. The lecture dedicated to the memory of Hermann Biggs and devoted to the subject of tuberculosis [inaudible] historical facts. Biggs had early become interested in problems of public health. And, he [inaudible] dissipation when he graduated from Cornell in 1881. He expressed his conviction that filth and poor hygiene were the primary causes of contagious diseases and microorganisms are only byproducts of disease. This was the official doctrine still taught at Belleview where Biggs was a medical student. And, he had learned it from both officials and a textbook of the day, Flint's Principles and Practice of Medicine. The 5th edition of this book was published in 1881 with the collaboration of Welsh who was shortly after to become the leader [inaudible] in pathology. The book [inaudible] with the subject of tuberculosis and mentioned, as its causes, [inaudible] position, unfavorable climate, [inaudible] in dull light, defective ventilation, deficiency of light, and depressing emotions, I'm quoting. The authors added that the doctoring of the [inaudible] of the disease has [inaudible] but general belief is in its non-communicability [inaudible] our understanding of microorganism is the causation of disease. It was in 1882, one year after these statements, that Flint and Welsh and by Biggs that Koch announced to a part of the world the discovery of the [inaudible]. Koch's achievement soon brought about the profound evolution in the medical point of view called tuberculosis and shifted emphasis from [inaudible] emotions to methods for preventing the spread of this lie through the community [inaudible] had begun. Biggs was quick in realizing all that the germ theory meant for tuberculosis. He did not provide any new fundamental view concerning the disease. But, what he provided was equally important. His contribution to the control of tuberculosis was to formulate and implement a practical program based on three simple concepts. First, to check the spread of infection by identifying the carriers of [inaudible] and by taking measures in the minimizing contact between infected and non-infected persons. Second, to help human beings in developing a higher resistance by advocating healthy living habits not only for patients in [inaudible] but first off for well persons a normal life. And third, to undertake a program of education aimed at mobilizing the intelligent and acting cooperation of the community as a whole in the anti-tuberculosis measures. The last point appears commonplace today. But, it was then a revolutionary departure in medical and social philosophy. It shifted the emphasis from treatment of the individual patient to control of the disease in society and it involved a new type of relationship between the medical profession and the public. The whole community was expected to take a constructive path in the fight of the disease instead of passively following the instructions of physicians. The vigorous campaigns based on these three subjects soon began all over Europe and the United States. And, by 1905 the anti-tuberculosis movement was on the way. And, when Biggs died, in 1923, his goal of incorporating scientific knowledge into a doctrine of action, understood and supported by the general public, had been reached. And, Biggs put point with pride to a startling decline in the mortality caused by tuberculosis. Although the statistics, [inaudible] statistics are notoriously untrustworthy, it may be justified to illustrate, by a few figures, what happened. Between 1800 and 1850 the tuberculosis mortality, over most of Western Europe and Eastern United States was of the order of 300,000 to 400,000 procreation. It was still better than 200 at the end of the 19th century. In 1923, when Biggs died, the tuberculosis mortality in the United States had come down to 100, a reduction of 50 percent within 23 years. In 1950, as you know, it reached the all time low of approximated 26 for the continent of the United States as a whole and was less than 10 in some of the Midwestern and Western states. A decrease of the same order has also taken place in several European countries and one may hope that tuberculosis, which was in John [Inaudible] words the captain of all the men of death of 1900, is now on the way [inaudible] of being conquered in the Western world. They've no one to question the validity of these facts. But, there are many, or there are some rather, who wonder whether the anti-tuberculosis movement, the anti-tuberculosis campaigns have had much to do with this startling achievement. And, even though, as will be brought out later, we shall not accept the interpretation presented by the critics, by the skeptics, nevertheless, the facts which they emphasize are of enormous importance and well worth considering at their face value. The skeptic point out that, in reality, the locality of tuberculosis had begun to decrease long before the anti-tuberculosis campaigns had gained momentum, indeed, had begun to decrease even before the discovery of [inaudible]. This paper can be illustrated by data obtained from all over the world. I shall select a few taken from statistics in this country and in England.

[ Silence ]

The data that will appear in the first curve deal with tuberculosis mortality in the Eastern Seaboards, New York, Philadelphia, and Boston. As you see, up to 1806 [inaudible] the mortality hovered around 350 to 450 to 100,000. Then, sometime around 1860, 1870, it began to decrease and has been decreasing, more or less, steadily ever since at a constant rate. This situation is not peculiar to the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. It can be recognized as so in European countries as well. And, in the next slide, I have attempted to compare, from official data, the mortality rates in the United States as a whole in the state of Massachusetts and in England where, and here again, you see that since 1860 the mortality rate has been decreasing at a very steady rate.

[ Silence ]

The skeptics also call attention to another very intriguing fact. It is not only the mortality of tuberculosis that has decreased during the past decades but also that of many other infectious diseases for which there has not been any organized campaign of control. First the death rate of pneumonia was decreasing at the same rate of that of tuberculosis even before the introduction of therapy with serum, [inaudible], and penicillin. This is illustrated in the form of this chart where that applies to mortality rates for [inaudible] and [inaudible] that pneumonia and tuberculosis [inaudible] practically paralyzed cause over a large number of years. The phenomena applies [inaudible] that is entered under the name of Barrier and [inaudible] it applies as so to other infections [inaudible] infections like scarlet fever and whooping cough which has all but disappeared as causes of deaths in New York City and many other cities. Clearly, say the skeptics, we are dealing with a profound biological phenomena which transcends tuberculosis independently of conscious human efforts. Something has happened which has increased the resistance of men in the Western world to many [inaudible] and destructive plagues. It will be shown later in this report that policies of public health have played a far more important role in the control of communicable diseases than the preceding statements might lead one to suppose. But, for the convenience of the discussion, it seems useful to consider first some of the hypothesis that have been formulated with an attempt to explain what appears to be a spontaneous decline in tuberculosis mortality during the past 100 years.

[ Silence ]

In order to account for the progressive decrease in [inaudible] and severity of tuberculosis the easiest assumption is to admit the typical [inaudible] have become less pathogenic for man. But, based, at the present time, no evidence whatever to substance shapes this hypothesis. All laboratory evidence indicates that the [inaudible] has retained the same pathogenicity that it had at the beginning of the [inaudible]. Furthermore, tuberculosis today, as in the past, manifest itself with extreme [inaudible] when it attacks [inaudible] newly exposed to it or any group of people compelled to live under conditions of physiological misery. It appears certain, therefore, that the same breed of [inaudible] that caused the great white plague of the 19th century is still at large in the world today. But, if the [inaudible] has not changed, its human host certainly has. There is no doubt that the response of man to the damage caused by infection is profoundly affected by many different factors and so some of these factors have varied in the Western world during the last century. It is more certain that all human beings can fall victim to tuberculosis if they are exposed to heavy infection at the time when their resistance is low. But, it is also true, on the other hand, that inbreed characteristics can spell the difference aborted infection and severe disease between life and death under ordinary conditions of exposure to the [inaudible].

[ Silence ]

[ Silence ]

Thus it is that in the course of widespread epidemics, the most accessible usually die young living [inaudible] probably spreads itself in smaller number of descendants. In fact, there is fairly good evidence that many tuberculosis families became almost extinct within a few generations during the 19th century. Only the individuals endowed with some degree of bone resistance are likely to die when the infection rate is high. This theory of familiar susceptibility has received support from experimental breeding of selective families of rabbits and guinea pigs different in their susceptibility to tuberculosis. Although it was not possible to obtain animals endowed with absolute resistance, the difference observed with the selective families were sufficiently great to have been of significance under natural conditions of exposure to infection. And, it seems fair to assume that, in man as well, some entries in, in bone resistance may have taken place through the selective process brought about by the prevalence of tuberculosis during the 19th century. The selective breeding of the least susceptible human families is not the only means by which a [inaudible] can increase resistance through procreation, for, it is known slight tuberculosis infection resulting in aborting disease can confer a certain level of immunity against another subsequent infection. It is probably that the immunization brought about by the agency of these abortive compact infection is particularly effective in certain age groups. The more prevalent tuberculosis is in a given population, the more numerous are the chances of children to become infected a fact which was the cause of much mortality among babies in the past. But, it is known, on the other hand, that severe tuberculosis is rare in children between the ages of 5 and 15, a fact that we shall, again, emphasize later. And it seems probably that, infection contacted during that age period, between 5 and 15, did provide some immunity against later experience. As a great majority of children were exposed to many sources of [inaudible] up to a few decades ago, those lucky enough to survive may have grown to form a partially immune [inaudible]. Thus, it is possible and probably that genetic selection and immunity acquired through [inaudible] infection has brought about an increase in the resistance of the disease among the population who have been living for many generations in congested cities.

[ Silence ]

But this type of immunity, resulting from genetic selection or from acquired immunity, is, at best, of a very low order and, certainly, inadequate to protect the individual exposed to the disease under unfavorable living conditions. There are many tragic examples of this fact. Thus, for example, tuberculosis has certainly existed for countless generations in the large Chinese cities. And yet, it is still today a terrible [inaudible] there among the poor classes. Their long history of contact with the disease fails to express itself in increased resistance probably on account of their [inaudible]. The tragedies brought about by the two World Wars have also demonstrated that [inaudible] resistance and acquired immunity are to no avail against infection when [inaudible] conditions become [inaudible]. Perhaps, the more startling example, illustration, of this statement is provided by the Jewish population of Central Europe. During this time, in Warsaw, the disease was much less severe among the Jews than among the Christians. And, it had remained so during the First World War although mortality had increased sharply in both groups. But, very soon after the beginning of the Second World War, the relation changed from 71 to 100,000 in 1930 the tuberculosis death rate among the Jews climbed to 205 in 1940 and to 601 in 1942. Whereas the respected figures were 186. 377, and 425 for the Christians demonstrating that the Jews had suffered much more from tuberculosis during the war although they had apparently been more resistant to it before the war. The resistance acquired during centuries of life in the ghettos of Central Europe proved of little help to the persecuted Jew when his tragic loads of [inaudible] became too heavy. It is not only under these conditions of extreme privations that disturbances of the social fabric can bring about an [inaudible] of tuberculosis. Even in England, the mortality rate began to increase immediately within a very few months after the onset of the First World War, and it remained high until the end of the war in 1919. Then, immediately, it resumed its downward course, the course that it had before the war. An impressionable increase, although less marked, [inaudible] was also observed during the Second World War. This fact is illustrated in the next slide.

[ Silence ]

As you see, in 1914, immediately after the war, tuberculosis mortality began to increase and the downward course was issued only after 1919 and the same process during the Second World War. All these facts make it clear that the environment is of fair amount importance to the problem of tuberculosis and probably far more important than any resistance derived from genetic selection or from immunization through aborting infections. Indeed, there's historical evidence for the importance of environment on the severity of the disease. The tuberculosis epidemic of the 19th century, in Europe, reached its greatest destructiveness during the first period of industrialization when the economic status of the labor classes was at its lowest. And, mortality began to decrease almost as soon as there was an improvement in the general standard of living. At the present time, as everyone knows, the disease is more prevalent and more severe among the poor than in the well favor classes in highly industrialized countries. But, universal agreement on the thesis that there exists a correlation between standard of living and resistance of tuberculosis lives through for many divergent views as to the specific manor in which one effects the other. Of course, improved standard of living usually means better housing. And, it is certain that chances of infection decrease by life in less crowded, more airy and more sunny rooms. Even today, the relationship between dense population in homes and factories and prevalence of tuberculosis is still in evidence. A recent survey of the [inaudible] in England, for example, revealed in a startling manner that the percentage incidence of tuberculosis increases dramatically with the number of workers in the plant. And, this similar relation had been found long ago in cattle. The larger numbers of animals in a barn, the more likely they are to contract tuberculosis. More or less similarly with improved housing there began during the second part of the 19th century, a crusade for more sanitary living condition. And, this movement, which was called the sanitary awakening of the 1840s, certainly contributed a great deal to minimizing the spread of infected particles. Education made spitting in public places a manifestation of bad taste, sneezing in somebody's face, an antisocial act, personal cleanliness became almost a duty and access to fresh air and sunshine everybody's like. It is, as I shall again emphasize later, this crusade for sanitation which has progressively evolved into the systematic anti-tuberculosis campaigns of recent decades. And, there's no question, of course, that the public health measures that have grown out of this increasing awareness of the importance of sanitation have done very much to decrease the rate of infection. Witness to this fact is the well known demonstration that where ever a community can afford to practice to the limit segregation of infected cases, detection of early cases, the tuberculosis infection rate comes down, falls down to an extremely low level. But, despite the effectiveness of anti-tuberculosis campaigns in checking the spread of [inaudible] the larger spot of the population eventually becomes infected even in communities enjoying a highly developed public health program. This is shown by the fact that most adults from 50 to 90 percent become and remain tuberculin positive even though they have never shown any evidence of clinical tuberculosis. And, I should say in passing that based on questionable evidence that the tuberculin positive state means that the individual has contracted an infection in the course of which their [inaudible] multiplied in that individual and that the tuberculin positive state is maintained only as long as living [inaudible] persist in that individual. Furthermore, unsuspected [inaudible] infestations even though in the active state, can often be found in the body of persons that have causes other than tuberculosis and are on their way of being infected by the disease. Thus, it is abundantly clear that mortality rates have been falling very much faster than infection rates. And, the reason for this extraordinary and very important facts are far from clear. It is possible, and generally assumed, that although the normal conditions of modern life, most particles of [inaudible] that reach an individual contain so few active [inaudible] that they can produce only a [inaudible] infection. But, this is only an assumption that has never been proven. It is [inaudible] that the susceptibility of any given individual to infection varies markedly from one time to another. And that, the recipient of an infected [inaudible] must be in their receptive state for infection to take and to cause a progressive disease. It is this consideration that make it imperative to inquire into the mechanisms by which the physiological state of the individual controls his resistance to infection. From [inaudible] clinicians have emphasized the importance of the patient's nutritional state for his ability to resist tuberculosis and here again historical and [inaudible] evidence speak clearly in favor of the view that tuberculosis is more severe in areas of social situations where the diet is deficient is what is vaguely called high class foods. Now, in reality, it is very difficult to [inaudible] the effect of diet from that of other unsanitary living condition.

[ Silence ]

[Inaudible]. But however, there are a few cases where diet appears to be the most important single factor in the development of the tuberculoses state in the population. For example, a striking relation has been observed between diet and the prevalence of disease through African tribes living in the primitive state in East Africa, these two tribes of the [inaudible]. The former tribe was found to live cheaply on milk, meat, and [inaudible] whereas cereal supplemented with some roots and fruits were the only foods of the latter tribe. And, marked differences were found in the incident of disease in the two tribes. [Inaudible] many times more prevalent among the vegetarian [inaudible] than among the meat eating [inaudible]. The cause of tuberculosis in Denmark between 1914 and 1918 provides a classical example of the relation of nutrition to the disease. The mortality of tuberculosis had been decreasing steadily in Denmark at least since 1900 until 1914. Then, in 1915, the mortality suddenly began to increased and increased until 1917 when again the downward course was resumed. Now, as you remember, Denmark did not take part in the First World War and was not occupied. And, as far as one can judge, the whole surface [inaudible] of the country was very little effected by the war. But, one thing, however, did happen. Throughout the first three years of the war, enormous amounts of meat and of dairy product were exported to England so that the consumption of these meat and dairy products decreased and reached a very low level among the village population. And, this was the time when tuberculosis increased. Then, in 1917, there came the thought of submarine war play which prevented the base from exporting their product to England so that again they had to start eating their own product. And, this was the time when tuberculosis again began to decrease. A similar situation occurred in France during the last war. Normandy and Brittany are two provinces where the tuberculosis rate was the highest in France and had remained high all throughout the first part of this century. But then, curiously enough, tuberculosis mortality began to decrease during the present war during the German occupation. And the summarize is as follows. It is well known that during the war, the meat and dairy product that Brittany and Normandy used to export to Paris and other large French cities would no longer be exported for obvious reasons of destruction of means of transportation. So then, for the first time, Normandy and Brittany became high consumers of their own farm products. And it happens that this was the first time when tuberculosis began to decrease, at the time when, precisely it was increasing at a catastrophic rate in all other parts of France. Let me emphasize again that, however striking these correlations appear to be, they are far from convincing because it is always very difficult if not impossible to dissociate the effect of poor nutrition from that of other factors very difficult to recognize and which might or so in their own way effect the cause of the disease. Moreover, even assuming that high class food products are significant in increasing resistance to tuberculosis, this in reality, solves very few problems because no knowledge at all is available of the mechanism where these increase resistance. No knowledge is available of the constituents of meat and dairy product that may be responsible for this beneficial effect. Despite the countless pages that have been written on the effect of nutrition on tuberculosis, there is no way to know, at the present time, whether the nutritional factors that promote resistance react [inaudible] or act [inaudible] by increasing either physiological well being or some specific defense and [inaudible]. There have been, [inaudible], a few timid events to determine the effect of known nutritional factors in infection. Many have assumed, for example, that proteins are the important components of the food, simply because one assumes that meat and dairy products are rich in protein. But, in reality, meat and dairy products also contain a large variety of substances other than protein that might be the effective factors. So far, all attempts to study the effect of known nutritional factors have given only equivocal results. Indeed, it is very unlikely that this approach will ever yield a solution to the problem for it would be a miracle if the food components that had been found of significance in the control of nutritional condition such as beriberi or scurvy [inaudible] would also be proved to be the ones that effect the cause of tuberculosis. In order to illustrate the problem by an analogy, let me only point out that the anti-pernicious anemia factor could never have been discovered by [inaudible] one after the other all the various substances that were known at the time to be concern in infectious diseases. In reality, the relation of nutrition to tuberculosis deserves much more imaginative work than it has received here to fold. Among other aspects of the standard of living that have been involved to account for the decrease of tuberculosis after 1850, particular mention has been made of the shortening of the working hours and of the decrease of the amount of the physical effort exacted from the labor classes. In coincidence with this social change was an increasing awareness, by clinicians, of the importance of rest in the treatment of the disease. But, in this case, again, universal agreement on the very general terms of the problem is not sufficient to prevent [inaudible] as to the specific manner in which rest acts and must be practiced. And this fact is not surprising when one realizes that the word rest is used in many different [inaudible]. Without laboring the point too much, I need only to call that ever since [inaudible] and up to a very few years decades ago, experienced clinicians prescribed rest in the form of horseback riding for many hours every day and for many weeks in succession. Today, of course, the same word rest is applied to bed rest, complete immobility, in bed if possible and for as long a period as possible. Then again, the same word, rest is used in a very different meaning. Modern physicians speaks of putting the [inaudible] at rest by artificial [inaudible] or other surgical procedure where certainly only the grossest [inaudible] kind of analogy can exist between the mind and the whole body with reference to rest. And then, throughout recorded history, it has been indicated that the mind of the tuberculoses patient be put at rest by the avoidance of painful emotion or financial worries or by sending the patient to live in pleasant surroundings. Thus, the word rest is used to express a whole range of meanings extending from the grossest physical concepts to the more subtle psychic influences. No one knows why and how rest exerts its beneficial effects, whether it favors the healing process [inaudible] already existent, or it increase resistance to the invasion of areas of the body as yet been effective. But rest, there must be mechanical, physiological, and psychological. However, the use of the word rest in so many different [inaudible] symbolizes the belief that resistance to tuberculosis is determined by factors of the host that can be influenced by the proper way of life. It is possible that a different physical and physiological and psychic factors each influence the response of the patient to infection by means of unrelated processes. But, it is also possible that all of them operate invalidly through one or a very few common mechanisms, for example, through the [inaudible] system that controls tissue reaction. Recent studies of the diametric effects exerted by the components of the [inaudible] adrenal system on the cause of tuberculosis illustrate one mechanism by which many types of stresses can have far reaching effects on infectious disease. And thus, it is probable that many empirical practices will eventually be found to have some common basis even though they appear so unalike in their outward mechanism. One of the great fields of investigation for the future is undoubtedly the physiological analysis of the complex interplay between psychic and sonar which results in the control of body processes and in turn in the control of infection. The fact that many nonspecific physiological processes are of enormous importance in determining resistance to tuberculosis is illustrated by certain epidemiological phenomena. Even at the time when tuberculoses infection was almost universal, the mortality caused by the disease in children from the age of 5 to 15 was, as I already mentioned, very much low than that observed among younger or older individuals. So, striking is this phenomena that many European epidemiologists have referred to it as the existence of the golden age of tuberculosis, the school age between 5 and 15. And, many attempts have been made to provide some explanation of this golden age of tuberculosis. Suffice to emphasize here that this phenomena must be the expression of some very general biological law for the high resistance of the 5 to 15 age group to infection is not peculiar to tuberculosis, it applies to many other infectious diseases.

[ Silence ]

As you will notice, I have brought in here the mortality rates for tuberculosis, pneumonia and bronchitis for the ill defined diseases listed on mortality certification of [inaudible]. Mortality of 100,000 in different age groups. And, as you will see, in all cases, the mortality is very much higher in both very young age group and in the older age group. And, in all cases, it reaches a minimum.

[ Silence ]

Age group from 5 to 15. This was proved in 1900, this is typical in 1940 or in 1950.

[ Silence ]

I could have listed many other examples to illustrate the peculiar resistance of infection of the 5 to 15 age group. But, it was defined to make the point a little sharper in the case of tuberculosis since this is the problem which we are discussing tonight. And what I should like to emphasize in particular that the resistance of the 5 to 15 age group could be readily demonstrated even at the time 1900 when infection was so prevalent and universal so that there could not possibly be, the resistance of the 5 to 15 age group could not possibly be through the lack of being infected. In the next slide, I have illustrated the same phenomena only for tuberculosis for the years between 1900 and 1940. And, taking the year 1900, you will see that in the age group of the one year the mortality was 300 per 100,000 whereas it was only 35 to 40 for the age group 5 to 14 that is one place as little. And, in reality, the difference is even very much greater than what appears on this chart because, naturally, in the younger age group under one year the chances of infection were, perhaps, smaller than those of the children from 5 to 14.

[ Silence ]

I became so much impressed in this phenomena while preparing this lecture, that, I began searching the literature for more evidence of it. And, unfortunately, it's only the day before yesterday that I found an analysis of the phenomena by Dr. Rich, analysis which I haven't had time to prepare in the form of this slide for you. But, let me state in a few words the way Dr. Rich handled the data. He took mortality rates for the year 1940 and, for each age group, determined the infection rate as measured by the prevalence of the tuberculin state, positive, tuberculin positive state. And then, he calculated, for each age group, the ratio of mortality to infection, here infected case, not modern day [inaudible] but mortality per infected population. And, if you recalculate data that way for 1940, you find that, in the age group under 1 year the mortality per 100,000 of infected cases is 5,000 that is 1 in 20 infected individuals died of tuberculosis. From 1 to 4 the mortality is still 150 per 100,000. Then, from 5 to 9 and 10 to 14, the mortality drops to 15. Then, from 15 to 19, the mortality jumped to 70. And then, from then on remains high hovering between 70 and 100. There could not be, I believe, any more convincing demonstration of the fact that physiological factors totally unrelated to infection do control the resistance of the individual to infection and that infection and disease are not synonymous.

[ Silence ]

All attempts to study the mechanisms by which selected breeding aborted infection, nutrition, physiological factors modify a resistance to tuberculosis are handicapped by our ignorance of many of the fundamental aspects of the pathogenesis of the disease. This is particularly true of cassation that peculiar form of [inaudible] crosses which constitutes such a characteristic finding in tuberculosis. The necrotic tissue that has caseated instead of undergoing ordinary [inaudible] is slow to resolve and may persist for periods of years providing a very peculiar environment for the tubercular [inaudible]. As long as the caseous lesion remains closed, the [inaudible] that it contains stop multiplying and even slowly decrease in number. This, at first sight, is a form of resistance to infection since cassation retards the multiplication of the [inaudible] within the lesion. But, what is equally important, and perhaps more important, is that some of the [inaudible] do survive for months or years with the caseous lesion even long after a clinical recovery has taken place. So, here we are with a very complex situation. On the one hand, the [inaudible] within the caseous area stop multiplying. But, on the other hand, they survive. This fact is of enormous importance to the infected individual and to the community in which he lives. For, through many ill defiance [inaudible] the body fluids penetrate, merely penetrate through the caseous layer and then the [inaudible] start multiplying again bringing about [inaudible] of the disease.

[ Silence ]

On the other hand, the prolong survival of a few [inaudible] within the caseous area is of [inaudible] significance by maintaining in the community reservoirs of infection that keep the [inaudible] smoldering. The importance of these facts has been repeatedly pointed out by commissions and epidemiologists. And yet, there is no understanding of the mechanisms that result in the production of caseous matter or the softening of caseous areas. Here is a vast field of inquiry that certainly cannot be solved by the simple bacteriological public health approach in which requires, instead, the integration of [inaudible] and physiological analysis. Now, many of you, certainly, will wonder whether the biological aspects of tuberculosis constitute a worthwhile subject of study at the present time since higher living standards and decreased chances of infection have gone so far already toward robbing the disease of its social importance and since the present medical practices have greatly improved the chance of the survival of the tuberculoses patient. But, unfortunately, the situation is not as satisfactory as the declined death rates would want to believe. There are close to one million individuals, in the United States alone, that harbor living [inaudible]. [Inaudible] the world at large is probably of the order of a quarter million or more. Complete eradication of the disease is therefore impossibility for many the case. Through enough, the programs that have been organized for the detection of active cases will bring to medical attention more and more patients in the early phase of their disease and thus improve their chance of recovery. The disturbing problems are already become apparent. To what extent will society be willing and able to provide hospital of sanitary [inaudible] for all those who are infected but only potentially sick? The economic cost would be staggering probably of the order of a billion dollars yearly for the United States alone. And, how many of the individual found to have tuberculoses lesion, otherwise feeling no unpleasant symptoms, will accept the idea of removing themselves from normal life for months or a year merely as an insurance against the spread of disease? For, it is well know that only in a few very small percentage of persons, those tuberculoses infection involved in participating illness. And days of the present time, no technique and no knowledge to determine which of the infected individuals are threatened with progressive disease. However useful in specialized cases, vaccination, anti-microbial drug therapy, or surgical intervention cannot possibly bring the solution to the social problem of tuberculosis. And yet, it is certain that a solution can be found. For, it must never be forgotten that tuberculosis is not an inevitable [inaudible] of human life. This is shown by the fact that tuberculosis has long remained practically nonexistent in many primitive societies and that it is [inaudible] as an important medical problem from some limited sections of the most highly evolved modern communities. It is only through gross errors in social organization and mismanagement of individual life that tuberculosis could reach the catastrophic levels that prevailed in Europe and North America during the 19th century and that still prevail in Asia and much of South America today. But, fortunately tuberculosis can be a fact along two independent lines, by decreasing the chances for infection and by rendering man more resistant to the damage caused by [inaudible]. And, it is only through this dual approach that the anti-tuberculosis movement can be seen in its proper perspective which is not merely a medical perspective but one in which a historical and social backgrounds loom very large. Through enough, the many factors that have contributed to the decline of tuberculosis in the Western World began to operate long before the anti-tuberculosis movement had acquired momentum. But, it must be realized that concern with public [inaudible] and [inaudible]. The campaign to eliminate filth and squalor from society and to bring pure air, pure water, pure food, and healthy living conditions to the multitudes originated with the great humanitarians of the early 19th century. The crusade for outdoor life, open windows, cleanliness of body and habits probably played a part larger than is usually realized in decreasing the spread of infection. Certainly, the germ theory of the disease helped in making more pointed and effective the policies of public hygiene. But it was the sanitary awakening that paved the way for the new health movement and that did much of the work usually connected to the bacteriological doctrine. It matters little whether crowding, [inaudible] spitting, dark airless rooms, and other unsanitary aspects of life and society are condemned in the name of human decency, sanitation, or the germ theory. The practical effects are the same in bringing about a way of life that minimizes the spread of certain infective agents and of [inaudible] in particular. Thus, when [inaudible] and unbroken continuation of public health work since the beginning of the sanitary reforms around 1840, the anti-tuberculosis movement took up and carried further the torch first lighted by the public minded physicians and laymen of the 1840s. But, whereas the germ theory of disease gave irrational basis to the empirical sanitary measures initiated in the 1840s and thus led to a more effective fight against the spread of [inaudible] no similar body of sanitary doctrine has come to guide the anti-tuberculosis movement in its efforts to render man more resistant to infection, there's as yet, no understanding of the mechanisms by which the body can ward off infection or progressive disease. And, there is no way of measuring, however inborn resistance or acquired immunity.

This ignorance directly handicaps all efforts to develop methods for producing a truly effective specific immunity. Present vaccination practices are only a crude beginning in this direction. At first sight, the situation appears most satisfactory with reference to the medical techniques used in the management of the tuberculoses patient. But, it is not unlikely that the results that of today are [inaudible] by the lengthy [inaudible] treatment could be obtained with more certainty less time [inaudible] human and economic values if precise knowledge were available of the factors that affect the cause of tuberculosis. At the present times advocates of healthy living have little to add to the teachings of common sense preached by the health providers of the past century. Even more in the case of immunological processes, the precise nature of the physiological mechanisms that control resistance to tuberculosis is entirely unknown and little more than lip service is payed to the need of investigating them. And yet, it is likely we are reaching the point of [inaudible] in what can be expected from the application of present knowledge. Certainly, there's more to the problem of nutrition than prescribing three square meals a day and rest will have to be defined in terms other than the number of hours spent in bed. So, 50 years ago, men of visions of goodwill, physicians, and laymen realized that tuberculosis could not be conquered by conventional medical philosophy of the time. Their efforts [inaudible] in the educational campaign that enlisted the general public as an understanding and perfect participant in the war against infection. There is really today a reawakening of the [inaudible] that brought about first the sanitary revolution in 1840 and later the anti-tuberculosis campaigns. Once more, it becomes urgent to force upon social [inaudible] the realization that progress cannot depend only on doing more and more of what has proven profitable in the past. A new educational process is needed to make the public and those responsible for the administration of scientific programs become aware of the fact that research should not be limited to working out more and more the case of established principles to gelding yesterday's lilies. The important advances are likely to come from the workers who stray away from the [inaudible] past and venture into unexplored fields. But, it is not easy to integrate these temperamental trailblazers into the rigid structure of large educational or research institutions and of government bodies. For this reason voluntary and unofficial agencies have an important role to play in searching, recognizing, and encouraging unorthodox approaches to the study of tuberculosis. It took much [inaudible] of spirit to establish, in the 1900s, the new philosophy that permitted physicians and the public to work together. It would take much imagination and vision to foster the development of new research concepts, of new points of view within the ever growing rigidity of our social framework. Needless to say, we must keep on exploiting the techniques of tuberculosis control that are the direct products of the germ theory of disease. But, we must realize that complete elimination of [inaudible] however desirable [inaudible] will not be achieved for a long time to come if ever. Since [inaudible] are likely to remain widespread, it becomes imperative to investigate the human and environmental factors that determine resistance to infection. The final step in the conquest of tuberculosis may well depend upon knowledge of the factors that prevent infection from manifesting itself in the form of destructive and progressive disease.
